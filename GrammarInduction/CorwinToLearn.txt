but they were still mine
i squeezed my eyes shut
and opened them
the room grew steady
where the hell was i
i was feeling halfway decent
would not they
i had been over narcotized
i suddenly knew
no real reason for it
from the way i felt
so i did
and i was
she went away
i remembered vaguely
i had no inkling whatsoever
i did not know
my legs felt pretty good
so i sat up
i was dizzy
my legs held me
stretched out and thought
i was sweating and shaking
visions of sugar plums
then the door opened
letting in light
she approached my bedside
just as she neared
i sat up
when do i check out
please roll up your sleeve
no you do not
i do not need it
but in the meantime
i will not permit it
so did eichmann
you ca not even walk
and there were internal injuries
we will see
whom did i know
what did that leave
i thought a while
and into a lake
i suddenly remembered
i tested my right leg
it was okay
went to the closet
no clothes there
then i heard the footsteps
i do not know
what is it
said the frown then
are you an m
and i refuse it
you will have your shot
i had say
after a time
and see what happens
where are my clothes
give them to me
within two minutes
i had say
where this place was located
off to the left
two on either side
under the white orderly jacket
i came to a stairway
off to the right
i took it
it was carpeted and quiet
rows of rooms
so i continued on
i found it
at a big shiny desk
this was no ward room
you are in trouble
his words were
what do you mean
and another one for malpractice
he stood up
get out of here
i helped myself and said
sit down and shut up
he sat down
you are breaking several regulations
i am checking out
nobody asked you
pony up this minute
or answer to the law
you are being most difficult
do not try it
i have several questions
and his tiny
he opened a drawer
put his hand inside
and i was wary
you will answer my questions
obviously you consider me dangerous
you may be right
he smiled weakly
lit a cigarette himself
which was a mistake
his hands shook
your sister checked you in
crossed to a filing cabinet
withdrew a card
i studied it
as the card said
safety back on
i told him
where are my clothes
i always heal fast
about the money
and the other one
do not be ridiculous
you had better consider it
and win or lose
or pay later
after a court order
i do not care
if he came across
he glared at me
name a compromise figure
after another pause
he told me
he named it
i snubbed out my cigarette
picked up another
a couple of eggs
the bacon was too greasy
i started walking
found a clothing store
three sport shirts
and pocket comb
someone was afraid of me
for some reason
it was no accident
i had that impression
i would find out
and someone would pay
very much would they pay
a terrible one
whoever he was
and i knew
more than once
i stared out the window
watching the dead leaves fall
and i wanted a reason
i ate a quick lunch
before i arrived
after about a thirty-second wait
white gravel driveway
leaves crunching beneath my feet
i had knocked
when the door opened
oh come in please
she told me
i entered a hallway
the wall mahogany
the gal departed
so i waited
the maid returned
please follow me
i did so
then paused on the threshold
like all libraries
it was full of books
it also held three paintings
eight stepladders of glass
v-necked dress of blue-green
i somehow knew
i knew her
holding my own smile
indicating a high-backed
i did so
and she studied me
how have you been
but here i am
returning the irony
you should drive more carefully
in the future
i will take greater precautions
have you eaten
a light lunch
several hours ago
when you were able
you always were unpredictable
she finally told me
what do you mean
walking in here like this
you know the score
file it away
maybe i do not
have not had a chance
since i woke up
you might mean it
in that case
let me think about it
i drew on my cigarette
but she did not
but you are smart
we will wait and see
wait for what
mine was a good steak
and while i ate
i pondered her
with full skirts
there was music
voices behind us
the vision faded
what had she been saying
in her green
behind the music
the dancing and the voices
i remember one night
her face grew slightly wistful
the cheeks smoothing
were not those the days
word of honor
for whatever that was worth
things have grown far worse
he still has his troubles
she went on
i told her
perhaps too quickly
whatever that meant
we sipped some coffee afterward
what of the others
which could mean anything
but sounded safe
stared at the ceiling
i am enjoying it myself
i lowered my eyes
one ca not
one never can
there followed a long
after which she said
do you hate me
of course not
and she showed her teeth
which were very white
and thank you
you are a gentleman
i bowed and smirked
you will turn my head
all things considered
and i felt uncomfortable
my anger was there
i felt that she did
what do you propose doing
she finally asked
you do not trust me
how could we
for the time being
we will see
of course you may stay
but let me warn you
realizing that i did
which is what you want
it meant something
that i did
and that was important
i hated him
that was one reason
perhaps i had even tried
that was it
with his wet curly beard
and his eyes
another sip of beer
i had be careful
until i remembered
and what of me
i suddenly felt
only i had pulled through
he was the one
was not he
my feelings replied
better than being dead
if i stayed
let my memories return gradually
then so be it
i had stay
and i remember
but you took the prize
but you laughed then
normally being so cool
do you recall
i think he has
to a certain extent
i feel he will
yes and no
how you gulled him
he hates you yet
the feeling pleased me
and in a way
you want more than security
i know that
the we had obviously shifted
i could tell
just a little
where i could act quickly
her eyebrows moved closer together
i am not proposing anything
though i felt i should
she stood up suddenly
seizing her whistle
and do not he ridiculous
maybe even sagged a little
then reseated herself
she finally said
do not even bother trying
i am not that important
and i do
so do not
has he approached you
i had rather not say
if he had
i like you
i forget why
i know it
we sat awhile
i should be strong
and she said
she repeated after a time
maybe he does
then she stared at me
her eyes slightly wide
and her mouth opening
i laughed then
do not he silly
but as she said it
i was suddenly afraid
she seemed relieved
she smiled then
so would i
for that matter
after i had reseated myself
it brings back memories
you are right
sipping her drink
do not cry
please do not
it makes me unhappy
there was something there
something electrical and potent
do you really believe that
i said loudly
you are crazy
if you do make it
i will remember you
nor my latest suspicions
that goes without saying
collapsed into the bed
and slept for eleven hours
and there was no message
i like libraries
beautiful and wise
all around me
or one of their relatives
and they were just places
so i entered the library
and africa still faced me
if we were related
i could not remember
what did i do
as a stranger
almost by reflex
in my mind
but that was not it
what else was involved
something caught mv eve
seated there at the desk
among other things
hung an antique cavalry saber
in my mind
edged weapons in particular
i could use the thing
nothing else occurred to me
drawer by drawer
all the usual items
this indicated something
way in the back
and it was locked
the shoehorn did the trick
facing to the dexter
with their wands
i replaced both drawers
before i continued my inspection
i suddenly knew
red and brown
and i knew him
his name was random
dark hair hanging long
not silver or metallic-colored
then came the swarthy
he was standing in profile
one arm akimbo
a plain cloak
high black boots
thumbs hooked behind his belt
were terribly strong and prominent
he it was
i was certain
then there was benedict
tall and dour
thin of body
thin of face
wide of mind
he seldom laughed
i liked him
it was me
dressed in black and silver
only mine was heavier
and a big
he resembled me quite strongly
and he stood laughing
about his neck
on a heavy cord
then came a fiery bearded
mainly of silk stuff
his chin was slight
but the beard covered it
and a sapphire
questing and abandonment about him
i both approved and disapproved
liked and was repelled by
his name was brand
remembered them all
with their strengths
for they were my brothers
they were my brothers
then i chuckled
i had on black slacks
and my jacket
i returned to the cards
my eyes filled with tears
why i do not know
and looking moist and sad
for some reason
was my sister
there were no more
and i knew
for the life of me
but that was about all
how i racked my brains
but to little avail
but now i courted it
wrapped up inside it
a sense of forsaken beauty
it was a place name
i knew then
there came no pictures
how long i sat so
i do not know
i realized then
i was wrong
it kept ringing
may i speak with mrs
rapid and slightly nervous
i am sorry
i told him
who am i talking to
i told him
and a long silence followed
just as he started talking
is she still alive
this is random
are you with her
as much as i can
wish me luck
in any way i could
he was resourceful
and on the other hand
but trust him
or at least a knave
in the hole
who was he running from
given the chance
it seemed strange
that was the answer
and fairly recently
i had judge
i had play on that
after a time
it subsided and i slept
there in the chair
after a much longer time
it was night outside
but she did not reply
the road to amber
i do not remember
be that way then
she lacked it
you are missing some trumps
i said then suddenly
she sprang to her feet
give them back
reaching for the whistle
i do not have them
she relaxed a bit
into the chair
i did not apologize
how far did you get
not far at all
were not they
did not you
but i ca not now
do not you
he will send a messenger
and still would
given half a chance
whatever you ran into
but you are in exile
like hell i am
she laughed again
you are crazy
what do you want
if a certain thing occurred
then she said
knowing that i would
whatever it was
but they felt right
so very right
she was kissing me
and maybe benedict
then she drew away
to the future
and we did
there was something bothering me
how old was i
i was far
all together and friendly
with no tension
no friction among them
that would be brother random
knowing i was right
her eyes widened
then she smiled
i had not
it made me feel safer
but he was random
and embraced me
after he had seated himself
he said to me
they are after me
they will be here soon
which we both ignored
people out of the shadows
or who sent them
maybe even six
i took a jet
they occurred around denver
i shook them in manhattan
he stalled for an instant
maybe even you
you did not
how tough do they look
he was a little guy
weighing perhaps one thirty-five
being his brother
i felt comfortably strong
how strong was i
what shall we do
they will enter
it has been too long
he told her
they are guided
i can tell you
the knocking came again
what does it matter
they both blanched slightly
we might as well wait
i might call the cops
they both laughed
suddenly looking at her
but she shook her head
we have the trump
i doubt it
and much more loudly
upon a sudden thought
flora shook her head
i followed him
and random observed
where are we
if i knew
i had tell you
for the moment at least
we are in this together
and i opened the door
and i stiff-armed him back
there were six
i could see that
what do you want
i asked them
and i saw guns
they are really there
you do not
they look wild
i felt a hackle-raising vibration
in that moment
somewhere off to my right
somewhere off to my left
six mean and vicious brutes
firing at the second
random leaped above me
brandishing his blade
and without thinking
random strangled him
for one thing
very bloodshot eyes
i counted forty-four teeth
we took their weapons
and i nodded
and i was lucky
after a time
while he was doing that
he cleaned off the blade
before he seated himself
so it would seem
random shook his head
if you want him
his eyes gleamed then
and his old smile appeared
of all my relations
i lit a cigarette
while i considered
you are thinking
he said while i thought
a few pranks
i will admit
all in all
think it over
i shook my head
we drank to that
the following morning
taken care of things
the countryside seemed strangely altered
but somehow things felt different
i was at the wheel
random at my side
i have been wondering
pure and simple
or something more
as i saw fit
i saw fit
i used the stock phrase
i just might try
he turned toward me then
you are asking me
whether i will help you
the answer is yes
i doubt it very much
so i did not
and there it was
right in my lap
what about now
he was silent
he lit a cigarette
i did the same
he finally said
i told him
three-quarters of a tank
i did this thing
we kept driving
then shaded over into pink
big yellow ones
do not worry
he said quickly
it could be worse
racing in the other direction
dressed all in gray
like a deep
sheltered and shaded
salty and sharp
all roads lead to amber
i am sure
turn right at the crossroads
what was happening
then the engine coughed
repeated the performance
it became a crescent
i said nothing
but when it cleared away
it was gone
whoever set up that block
that was only the first
i hit the brakes
it shook me a bit
when the dust cleared away
i combined several into one
i considered random
what was his power
his hands in plain sight
for which he was solving
and the key to it
i knew in a flash
was remembering amber
but i could not
the road curved abruptly
the desert ended
after a while
it was hard-packed
the hills went away
and there were many shadows
off to the right somewhere
i heard a howl
shook his head
we are making headway
my brother remarked
and i nodded
full of muddy water
breathe slowly and deeply
as quickly as we can
but it swerved
at the very last instant
to my right
the truck was a tanker
as i stepped out
rounded the car
and began apologizing
i said i am sorry
i told him
you had better move along
put that away
i told him
you bloody fool
so who the hell cares
in this generation
i told him
had i chosen
he bowed his head then
i am sorry
i told him
if we can
random called out
he was not kidding
i knew i was strong
but on the other hand
so i stooped
with a sucking sound
it was heavy
it was heavy
but i was carrying it
wrung out my socks
random jumped in
i told him
and we did
or glass-like substance
of tall buildings
thin and fragileappearing
said my brother
stop the car
i did this and waited
and random told me
stop and blow your horn
i did so
go on in
i drove in
under more ordinary circumstances
of enormous girth
what will it be
fill er up
pull it up a bit
and asked random
look at it
he told me
and i did
followed by the letters
by the way
i am getting hungry
we looked around us
hung up the hose
and passed them to him
check your oil and water
he added a little water
salty tasting beer
a tyrannosaurus leaped before us
hesitated for a moment
then went on his way
off to the left
three more pterodactyls passed overhead
whatever that meant
but on the other hand
so we drove on
what are you doing now
as we drove along
there was bare
black earth between
after a while
i saw splotches of green
but it was a very
very bright green
spotted occasionally along our way
mighty and majestic
of a deep
slightly tinged with gold
they were enormous pines
you are doing all right
better than i had expected
i am doing my best
look at it
we have got the sky
not knowing what it meant
he nodded then and said
you are okay
never very successfully
and i realized
me and flora
and probably others
but these i had recalled
i knew for sure
startled a deer
walked through it
hunted in it
my arms beneath my head
i love this place
and random replied
you always did
i could not be sure
said random suddenly
the horn sounded again
whatever he hunts
what a quaint notion
then the horn sounded again
and he remarked
the speedometer said seventy-five
and the horn sounded again
much nearer now
three long notes
off to the left
though still far from amber
said my brother
he will pursue us
or his shadow will
what shall we do
it was true
some inner voice told me
out of shadows
and then i saw him
pacing the car
like a flag
his legs were a blur
but julian had spotted me
with their tough
but i knew
for a certainty
that the word
if we do not
so i hit the brakes
pawed the air
the dogs milled about
what a surprise
in his slow
is not it
how have you been
i am in good shape
and random nodded and remarked
through the windshield
i enjoy slaughtering beasts
at the time
such as amber
rather than there
after about five minutes
i heard the horn
the horn sounded nearer now
and random was muttering obscenities
after about six minutes
thundering along the road
his pack all around him
baying and slavering
random rolled down his window
damn that armor
but try for the horse
i already have
if he gets close enough
he wheeled then
with a magnificent leap
get more dogs
accounting for six
i blew the horn
but it did not work
i swerved toward them
but the horse danced away
do not fire yet
you are crazy
he told me
he lowered his weapon
i ducked beneath his blade
seized his arm
and random kicking them
call them off
be about it
in my own good time
i told him
in the meantime
anything i have got
i stepped back
i told him
he did this thing
random resumed his own seat
why not just kill him
although you will torture me
and that is not much
start with that then
he told us
what of benedict
i do not know
i have not heard anything
he might even be dead
over a thousand
you are doubtless correct
we will see
we will see
somewhere to the south
i do not know
we drove on in silence
within an hour
that sounds likely
what about it
advanced upon us
get the picture
and he recognized us
to our right hand
and he got out
a little closer please
a while back
i told him
it was along way
we left him standing there
his brows woven together
i put it in neutral
killed the engine
i have been thinking
for what he tried
in the meantime
or business deals
staring downward through the smoke
beneath the deep blue
of royal blue
i was reciting
is it true
i told him
heading toward a wooded valley
after almost half an hour
we reached the bottom
then turned on the engine
at its sound
invisible till then
the mountains reared
i had almost forgotten
and as i shifted gears
then i noticed my shirt
on closer inspection
i find myself garbed effectively
how do you feel
i told him
and by the way
it would not go unnoticed
and random said
what do you mean
things have gone too easily
he told me
i do not like it
these woods seem strangely still
i do not know
we made maybe two miles
death and dreck
i lied again
so we did
we passed among trees
and the moon slowly rose
and lighting up the night
random told me
too far and too fast
he wore a short
burnished one himself
but now we are here
what was that
but nothing more was heard
there was a soft glow
as from a campfire
in the distance
we heard no more sounds
into the woods
to the right
could that be
i think it may
from those guys colors
he ca not have her
but i know you do
and he unsheathed his blade
i did the same
i told him
rising into a crouch
and we rushed them
maybe two minutes
thanks for my life
which was news to me
and we are interested parties
if you are smart
she was lovely
and squeezed her
i was a prisoner myself
they were taking me back
at any rate
i am not sure
not of you
yet you escaped
that was different
as you can see
i did not succeed
you have now
keeping watch on our trail
after a time
the question was too basic
up to his neck
i told them
he was saying to himself
are you kidding
i want your help
not your head
i have made some guesses
what amber is
i told him
or for that matter
who i am
and then random whispered
what do you mean
you were the boss
he told me
i can see it now
and subconscious sneakiness
she was stupid
now i really need you
you can if you want
and she did not reply
i saw it happen
though only in shadow
and to my amazement
and there were more cries
we had better move fast
and we followed
where are we going
to the sea
you are dead
without memory even
it will restore your memory
are you game
but what is the pattern
be told me
it is the ref
everything in amber is duplicated
as in a mirror
should have the same effect
then i am game
in that case
we will keep heading south
you will go with him
and i was glad
i was afraid
but i was glad
we walked all that night
and small polished stones
and the sea beyond
rising and falling
then looked away
maybe i did
gestured with her head
parallel to the shore
random and i followed
my eyes followed the gesture
overhead a hawk circled
how much farther is it
that cairn of stones
about eight feet in height
builded of head-sized
worn by the wind
and we did
after perhaps twenty-five paces
the hawk descended
it swooped at random
it rose and dropped again
dogs barking and horns blowing
one is imminent
but i was
i was very worried
and i followed
and random followed
and i heard his voice
they were clear
even if the horses do
i tried saying
he said quickly
how can that be
if we make it
you will know
so i protracted it
there were more bubbles
down it led
we will be safe
said my sister
you will be safe
in that case
we will make it
and after another ten steps
perhaps fifteen steps lower
and so on
it was white
it became brighter
about two feet in height
as atop a huge torch
they are after us
four of them on horseback
we hurried though
only the stairway was illuminated
the archway loomed ahead
perhaps two hundred feet distant
shining like alabaster
and carved with tritons
i drew my blade then
random followed suit
they were almost upon us
near to the rail
when he struck
a great billow of blood
like crimson smoke
the horse continued past
as he fell
and he drifted
i struck at him
hovering there above me
and he parried again
then he was silent
the blood billowed above them
then we sheathed our blades
and random said
i have had it
we passed through them
we entered the city
there were buildings
seeking after remembrance
that i knew
i examined our escort
and black hair
inside the city
and bright-bellied fishes swam by
there came a cool current
like a breeze
as we turned a corner
and after a few steps
a warm one
like a wind
inside and out
and her hair was green
though streaked with silver
her mouth was small
her chin was small
what seek you here
outcasts of amber
if he is loved here
we are lost
so we come asking aid
as you know
but only a small thing
for as you know
i suddenly recalled
he would pay it
mocking them the while
had this power
i suddenly knew
the thing i would ask
who dwells here with you
that is true
for he does
in that room
upon the floor
traced in fiery outline
here moire blinked several times
swept it over random
returned it to me
and she smiled then
you have my permission
as to that
we expect no boons
save for random
who will be quite safe
what mean you
for random would not
surely you recall
i have heard this said
it is true
when martin came of age
what say you to that
random said nothing
but he nodded abruptly
so be it
and so it was
she told me
and i thee
your exploits are legend
may i enter here
and i stegped aside
as soon as possible
i told her
she considered this
where have you been
very far from here
i doubt it
the lady is kind
but not wrong
pray tell me
what of my brother random
are you certain
in my way
i love him
as a brother
i have considered it
she told me
and i am certain
so may it be
and looked away
i hope so
she told me
save possibly for benedict
i did not knew this
please bear with me
i shall miss benedict
an he be dead
but he was gentle
as are you
she told me
then she said
when do we eat
there was more softness beneath
and her hair was green
upon the couch
i gave her her ballad
her lips replied without words
after about twenty paces
my brother said
it is faster that way
beside the glowing
within the double of amber
so different from waters elsewhere
which irritated me
we moved toward one
bound in metal
towering to twice my height
then moire smiled
just at me
she could not turn it
knocking hers aside
there came a click
composed mainly of curves
as the case may be
somewhere way to the back
and then came the throbbing
then somewhere within my blood
my nervous system
this pattern was recorded somehow
and the girls giggled
they ca not hurt you
but keep concentrating
do not stop
whatever you do
and as he spoke
heading toward its far end
the girls trailed behind us
i whispered to him
i figured you would
do not worry about it
if i am obnoxious enough
be kind to her then
stay the full year
and i will be generous
then he squeezed my arm
friend of yours
is it a deal
i strode forward
i took another step
i took another step
back upon itself
i took ten more paces
i fought it
it was the first veil
i suddenly knew
a good sign
suddenly the pressure was eased
three more steps
so much more
i took another step
they were all about me
i staggered alone
the death wagon thundered by
how long i wandered
i do not know
he half carried
i sat upon the floor
until i feel better
you have got the plague
and he spat then
got to his feet
and staggered out
they were disappointed
perhaps ten hours later
i was weak
but rational once more
looking for something
then came a pins-and-need
since the sixteenth century
that i could not say
i had find out
it was the second veil
it was true
there had been eight sisters
and two were dead
or in our own universes
it is an academic
though valid philosophical question
whatever the ultimate answer
another curve began
as i remembered amber
and every other city
i remember thee
deep inside me
i never really did
golden and red
and the temples
will always contain
and even now
i remember thee with love
i essayed it
it was tricky
so devilish tricky
i struggled on
they are mine
some vicious and cruel
white unicorn rampant
facing to the dexter
would make it
no matter what the resistance
their strength redoubled
save for amber
i walked three more curves
a straight line
another short arc
a straight line
and the final veil
the waters were cold
then my breast
they were into my eyes
they were all about me
then a short arc
ending in blackness
i did it
and by god
not even the pattern
but why bother
they were waiting for me
we had saved her life
and as for moire
and like that
before i did so
i saw a fleeting shadow
no one would
i was cold
and i was damn tired
from the pattern
after a while
so i arose
i knew where it was
the third floor
the library was empty
i considered everything
including the display cases
after maybe ten minutes
it was tricky
pack in hands
i knew why
then i read them
save for one
what could i do
i exposed myself
i rose and said
how could i forget
after all this time
l will do that
and he did
so i did
there was a time
addressing this ancient visage
since i still live
nor upon what grounds
but by god
he deserves opposition
tell him that
but different ones than before
what say you to this
hail to thee
lord of amber
how go things in amber
as he replied
when it comes to things
on other counts
i know a way
i heard it snick shut
you want the throne
do not we all
i told him
i guess so
with a sigh
it was not that merciful
the first time
as i remember
i find myself suitably attired
so come at me
i moved around the desk
i told him
try and take it
and i did
which he parried
i set it aside
with my right toe
i parried his attack
and he mine
then i lunged
and parried again myself
which involved a beat
this is true
step by step
the greatest alive
was brother benedict
one way or the other
and i was afraid
the man was magnificent
i kept backing away
i cursed this
i am damn good
by fighting a defensive fight
it was risky
with my left hand
it was a big
my sword arm remained intact
perhaps you were a fool
you are slowing
and i tried a hard
he parried it
and you have had it
backing away from my attack
maybe i was as good
that was rather stupid
they have gone for axes
i held it and said
with his left arm
he dashed across the room
picking up a small chair
try and take me now
you are scared
i crossed the room quickly
to the opposite wall
with my left hand
you are lucky
next time we meet
there came a thunk
he had thrown his blade
as i did
in the battle
this made me feel good
if we met again
i would court the chance
i was certain
my shoulder hurt
but i forgot it
one was the pattern
seldom used for this purpose
another was the trumps
i could almost trust him
he was my brother
i stared at him
his beard blazed
i suddenly realized
his rings flashed
and his lips moved
who is it
and i heard the words
then come to me
if you would
i took a step
thanks for the assistance
you are wounded
later that night
then he reflected
i do not know
what are your plans
i decided upon complete honesty
we all want the throne
random would like it
the same goes for julian
and so that leaves us
pouring us each another drink
you are right
bless your heart
we will see
we sipped our whiskies
i told him
is my affair
when it comes to monarchs
then we understand one another
for the time being
he smiled within his heard
you needed someone
i told him
but you are here
if we both do
i thought about it
so i said
tell you in the morning
my shoulder throbbed a bit
but the whisky helped
after a time
we were almost maudlin
it is strange
and he retired
there were thousands of them
and i was envious
on the other hand
it was a good thing
before i quaffed it
i lighted a taper
in its light
after a time
it came to life
who is it
his arm was bound
how are you
he cursed then
and i laughed
but i continued
he told me
i wondered though
as i approached sleep
it would not be easy
and six-digited hands and feet
each bore two short blades
hooked at the end
i asked him
the lord of evil
i nodded and said
and passed on
how large is your army
i asked him
around fifty thousand
i told him
i have a way
not yet enough
and barely a beginning
i am still building
he will decimate them there
and i will penetrate them
i do not know
where are they
i turned away from him
they are no more
i am certain
i am sorry
i will go
i told him
he cried out
i spoke hastily
if nothing else
stay with me
i will even apologize
that is not necessary
i will stay
and i did
i walked among shadows
dark and clawed and fanged
and we took another drink
i felt some remorse
i knew that also
he was gone
he was dark
after a time
there came a reply
is this a joke
what do you want
what have you got
you know that
but i watched his hand
where are you
what do you mean
i moved my hand
and he cried out
you have guessed it
and you are not interested
i did not say that
you mean the power
which might enter expecting reinforcements
if you fail
that regency would be nice
i will take it
when be learned the score
i concluded the deal quickly
promising him evervthing he asked
as no heads were involved
they got along like brothers
we were their gods
and that was that
i saw the fleet
then there came a scream
it was a horrible
came the cry
how can i
who is that
deliver me from this place
where are you
and another scream
i did not know
to the throne of amber
but what of brand
where was he
what was happening about him
lord of amber
his hair the same
what had happened
i still did not know
but he was gone
i stared and concentrated
there came a responding movement
though ever so weak
very faint and distant
as though through a seashell
immersed in its monotone humming
where are you
what has happened
that you are gone
sounding even further away
what of you
how can i help you
i am beyond help
take the throne
you have my blessing
so dad lived
that was interesting
he still lived
why had he left
where had he gone
what kind of
and how many
i did not hate him
sure as hell
he had been big
he had been powerful
and he had been there
that was about it
as we knew it
so what do you do
as for me
he had four admirals
as the case might be
i was troubled by this
as i saw it
but as a tactician
almost matchless in his guile
the only thing was
i was worried
but with the impending coronation
if we lost
we were creamed
which i did not
its smoking craters
though vicious and poisonous beasts
and its big purple plants
like spineless cacti
if we made it
i could take us home
home for me
eight hundred sick and abandoned
there is only amber
the real city
upon the real earth
which contains everything
by its very existence
then one may walk
crossing through shadows
and there stop
save for family intrusions
master of the line
the third was the pattern
as it were
the other way
as we had driven
he kept adding
when everything corresponded
he knew we had arrived
it was no real trick
for had he the knowledge
the walk through shadow
what would come of this
no one knew
all the surviving brothers
we princes of amber
i am sure
felt it much better
we passed ghost fleets
the sea turned dark
the clouds collected overhead
then the winds arose
as the poets say
the sky turned black
i am sure
i know i did
that was for damn sure
and there was no letup
life is full of vicissitudes
you bet your sweet ass
if he has any brains
he just did
we just had one ourselves
monster or storm
two hundred dead
keep the faith
hold the fort
and talk to me later
before he cut off
we made it
and i asked him why
she says wait a while
till he relaxes
i shook my head
i warned you
i asked him
he shrugged again
what do you think
is he a cretin
then he knows
from a wavering of shadow
he might win
i will confess
he asked me
he told me
as a prince
is not it
but i have committed myself
then you are crazy
see you around
and that was that
and it troubled me
incapable of trust
but there i was
as random had told me
so i tried something myself
out there on the ocean
if he could
and he did
so i let things be
we sailed on
into the jaws of death
what can one say
but i held the wheel
it was electrified
it drove us apart
i will buy it
weather or no
we will beat him
i hope so
but everyone had misgivings
so we sailed on
but i was scared
it was all true
all well and good
when i saw him approach
through an amplifier
i have got you outnumbered
what of our arrangement
null and void
pray hear me
and grant me this then
they appreciate their positions
i am sure
one by one
for it was probable
whatever i did
random had been right
and his voice was agitated
we are in trouble
seventy-three ships made it through
damn his eyes
do as you see fit
they are coming again
and the contact was broken
and sought contact
if my guess was correct
he was in southern waters
and if he would
and before i could reply
he was gone
he was right
i lit a cigarette
i paced the deck
it was no longer morning
soon it would be noon
perhaps two hours
i fingered my cards
there was that power present
they had been so designed
the details were unknown
he was a great artist
he had vanished ages ago
perhaps my blood was tainted
softened me perhaps
and i was stricken speechless
through clenched teeth
there was no reply
i said or thought
and he chuckled
be told me
it is too late
he withdrew slightly before it
i could see him now
by attacking me first
i sought for an edge
but could not find one
what time was it
could two hours have passed
was that it
i could not be sure
i feel your troubled thought
they are guiltless
without releasing you
our minds are too proximate
i will keep my word
you know it yourself
you know it yourself
i ca not risk it
and i knew it
your swordsmanship has increased remarkably
who may well be dead
do not flatter yourself
do not bother
and he smiled
reading my thought
which burned all too clearly
julian i spit upon
had you asked him
i might have pardoned him
save for your present recommendation
would not you
it reveals his true attitude
catching it from my mind
i caught the thought
i chuckled at his irritation
i will have you soon
boring into his mind
hurting him with my hatred
i lashed at him
seeking at least this payment
seeking this vengeance
for the auto accident
i struck at him
the contact was broken
and i stood there shaking
i had done it
i was stronger than he
on that engagement alone
served me that day
i called out
and as a man
we took the sixth
they came to us
we took them too
two more moved toward us
we combined crews once more
my men were tired
we had overwhelmed it
and transferred the standard again
because amber is the center
i could have made it
i did not
i asked him
and with this
how fare you
we won the battle
but lost many troops
how go things with you
give me escape
about the head
and some dried meat
a cold rain at that
we could march to amber
filled with flurries
save for the hairy ones
the big red guys suffered
we were attacked by tiger
and wolf that day
and the thaw began
dry autumn prevailed there
with triple security cordons
and julian led it
but not enough
amber lay directly ahead
a few leaves fell
after a time
we smelled the smoke
after another time
we saw it
flapping skyward all about us
they moved toward us
with their crunching
and as they came nearer
way back along the lines
a panic arose
there were cries
and the smoke grew thicker
welling thunder as we ran
washed over us
we ran faster
and we were not mistaken
we leaped over them
we circled around them
we were on a trail
fleeing with us
their droppings fell among us
i suppose i might have
and over thirty behind us
we raced on
but the fires outpaced us
wiping ashes from our eyes
spitting such from our mouths
we ran through burning grasses
heading down a long slope
and our speed increased
it seemed like hours
but must have been less
as i did
more arrows fell about me
i touched bottom
exhaling as i rose
i burst through the surface
and surfaced then
so i forced myself on
when i surfaced this time
i looked all around me
both banks seemed empty
but so did the river
it did not seem possible
then crawled ashore
crawled into it
when i awoke
i wished i had not
every inch of me ached
and i was sick
i lay there for hours
and slept again
but a little bit stronger
where are you
damned if i know
near the sea
you are near the river
then stay put
he told me
and that was it
i stayed put
stood erect and swayed
took several deep breaths
and stepped forth
i am here
blades in their hands
as i said it
but they recovered
paid me deference
i made it without leaning
we marched along the beach
my thigh was healthy
we marched on
the next day
the distance was ten
and we kept on
by that time
the next day
i felt even better
like robert e
lee at chancellorsville
and we took them
but we had won
there was celebration that night
we had won
i had lost the fleet
i did not like it
there was a stairway
this would narrow soon
the way grew steeper
and two men fell
two steps were gained
and another man fell
sometimes he would be red
fighting for every step
once we reached the top
it is almost a decoration
should he perish
six of the vanguard remained
then five remained
we pushed on
as the case may be
onward and upward
he fell immediately
and then there were two
and he chuckled
he leaped forward
dislodging him also
as i watched and advanced
he was good
he advanced like a whirlwind
i almost believed it
he used every trick available
he tripped the warriors
he seized wrists and twisted
with his full strength
but he smiled constantly
this helped him
worked on their nerves
i later learned
he was tiring
i could see that
but there was not
so i followed
i suddenly felt for him
yet he was fighting on
he killed three more men
he was not
as he slew that man
casting him downward
then he cut upward
he took the next two
it struck against his head
and though he impaled himself
and he did
as i parried and thrust
we passed through
we entered amber
before he reached the bottom
we had underestimated
all the way around
we were outnumbered now
if things went badly
things went badly
we fought on until twilight
we were overwhelmed
why had i done it
but i could not
i had probably have surrendered
so we fought on
they killed everyone but me
no matter what
we had lost
i visualized racks and braces
flames and tongs
i did not know
i lay there
wrapped in my cloak
if i had not
i knew despair
and i so tired
i do not know
i emptied the tray
i waited there
and i waited
then they came for me
after a long walk
when we reached the top
which i did
when i was dry again
i was given fresh garments
of black and of silver
i donned them
its clasp a silver rose
you are ready
come this way
i followed him
and the guard followed me
fetters on my ankles
had i resisted
so i complied
i was a prisoner
many of whom i knew
and some strange faces
there was the minstrel
he had been knighted
how are you
and i am just fine
louder than necessary
and he did not blush
i stretched then
but he did not
and it was
except for me
he raised his
and everyone raised his glass
except for me
pick it up
shove it up
he did not
but my voice carried
as i said
the serving began
and better than most
but my presence was felt
s right hand
and this followed shortly
then there was a procession
except for me
there was silence
the crown of amber
and i fought
then to me
in a whisper
he will crown himself
it was studded with emeralds
i did not move
i said simply
i was struck again
i finally said
and reached for it
i crown me
king of amber
another blow fell
i told him
feeling my shirt grow wet
this time i hurled it
now hear me
all you present
king of amber
long live the king
cried the nobles
i spat and was beaten
i do not remember
is always potent
i clawed at the straw
and no tears came
there was still the pain
i rose to my feet
four paces in width
five in length
i ate and i drank
but i was not refreshed
my head ached so
after seven sleeps
better he had killed me
but could not guess
this much i knew
and this comforted me
time went on its way
had i been there months
or had it been years
this helped-thinking of nothing
now it was useless
i could still see
in my nightmares
i could visualize myself
pallid and thin
i could not even cry
i ignored it
it came again
in the interrogative
i crossed the cell
how are you
i laughed at that
oh just fine
steak and champagne every night
and dancing girls
i am sorry
i would if i could
he told me
i know that
i brought you something
what is it
some clean clothes
a head of cheese
two bottles of wine
a carton of cigarettes
and a lot of matches
you are all right
how did you arrange this
he owes me too much
you and me both
that part was easy
four months and ten days
wenching and drinking
and what of random
he was taken
with a crossbow
why was not he slain
moire has quite a kingdom
she liked you
did not she
how did you hear
who i had never met
and i wondered at this
a week later
if she really loves random
those were my sentiments
how fare my sisters
he must have died
his body was never recovered
what of benedict
as absent as ever
how about brand
as it stands at present
if at all
do not do it again
he squeezed my hand
and was gone
in my weakened condition
i had a cigarette
sat down on my mattress
leaned back against the wall
but i wrote music
practicing the martial arts
he was lousy at them
i had never regretted it
and when the wars beckoned
i made him my squire
at jones falls
and he had deserved it
i loved him
in his name
he was a good man
he was king in amber
so much so
i do not know
god knows what they held
there are none of you
could cope with my family
within the numbing darkness
for a long while
though i rationed myself carefully
resisting the compulsion
the handy temptation
i nursed my last pack
when they were all gone
i felt depressed
what problems was he encountering
even by imperial decree
and what of my brothers
what was she doing
or his queen
and what of my sisters
i still perspired and shuddered
and sometimes woke up screaming
even for an hour
when i awakened
there was food
i felt filthy
wherever that may be
we were not
i played mental games
i told myself stories
i recalled the elements
the miniaturization of cities
the herds of clouds
where were they now
and when all was done
i thought of amber
when i did so
after an interminable time
but it had been long
and he repeated it
what do you want
come with me
and he took my arm
we walked along the corridor
from the echoes
cut it off
all twenty of them
then i was bathed
they hung loose on me
i was loused also
but forget that
king of amber
long live the king
no one spoke to me
which was something
with the same finale
ditto for the third
every other month
something was wrong in amber
to all and sundry
they were destroyed
was still a prisoner
his wife had joined him
one day it was there
which i had been saving
if he found this out
so i rejoiced
off somewhere to my right
so had general macarthur
off somewhere to my right
after a time
i had grown new eyes
my fingers told me
but i had done it
given sufficient time
after two years
it had gone away
with my burned-out orbs
and i had been right
they felt intact
and the sight was returning
i had lose them again
if anyone cared
but even if it had
i lit a cigarette
paced some more
and assessed my possessions
there was my clothing
my sleeping mat
i also had matches
if he came at all
i had wanted a knife
what he did not know
which i did not have
the door was mainly wood
one near the bottom
right above the gate
the door opened outward
but it was a beginning
day after day i worked
when he had passed
i had resume work
i had raise the bar
i had be out
he might be overconfident
thinking i could not see
on the other hand
maybe i was kidding myself
then if i succeeded
i had walk it
there i would recuperate
i was technically its liege
then there were footsteps again
i returned to the door
a chunk of stale bread
a crock of water
i positioned the mat
i was about halfway through
then i heard the chuckle
it came from behind me
who is it
and my voice sounded strange
and he chuckled again
but i held it
he was a small man
now squinted against the light
he chuckled again
do not you know me
you drew me
in exquisite detail
he said at last
i remember you
i am not
and he pirouetted before me
how is your father
have you seen him recently
did he put you here
and i am his prisoner
then i have seniority
he told me
i heard him weeping
he said after a time
he did not trust me
i described it to him
and he locked me in
that was not very nice
that was fun
how did you get here
into my cell
i asked again
i told you
through the wall
of course not
through the shadow wall
have a piece of bread
and handed it to him
if you see your father
what have you got
you have dined with me
i know the keeper
i told him
a very simple subject
and rather an appealing one
i will fetch you one
if you had like
i have a stylus here
i told him
he was silent a moment
the illumination is quite poor
and i apologize for them
he chuckled again
i asked him
is not it
then with several deft strokes
it was amazing
daft as he was
his skill was intact
i encouraged him
i told him
he pouted a bit
he sketched a tiny study
a skull on the desk
a globe beside it
i stood there shaking
full of mixed feelings
he was back again
i just thought of something
i told him
i just wondered
walked toward it
and vanished once more
the power was there
i could feel it
what could i burn
my sleeping roll
that straw would be drier
and the cloth would burn
i cleared half the floor
down to the bare stone
i cursed then
the less smoke the better
this was not too likely
i struck my last match
when this got going
it almost did not take
and then a flame
i tossed on the third
then sprang higher
the magic was still there
i stepped forward
i stood upon the sandy
i had escaped
it was high
it was locked
they swayed gently
i knocked again
his dark eyes squinted
he spoke rather loudly
who are you
what do you want
come in then
lean on me
take it easy
come this way
which were extraordinarily messy
and pieces of nautical equipment
suggested i lie down
i removed my boots
i would not be dirty
a pitcher of beer
a great slice of beef
i stuffed myself
i gluffed myself
i ate everything in sight
i emptied both pitchers
then i felt tremendously tired
before i knew it
when i awakened
it was chilly out there
then went dark
then went dark
the water was cold
crawled beneath the blanket
in the morning
when i awoke
then i borrowed a razor
i bathed again afterward
you look kinda familiar
and i shrugged
so i did
out of whole cloth
what a disaster i detailed
you just rest easy here
he told me
as i recovered my strength
he was apolitical
i told him
were not you
how had you know
i had remembered
he told me
that seems long ago
any day now
not too much longer
not much longer at all
gentle and questing at first
i immediately stood stock still
i paced then and wondered
via my trump
i was not sure
whoever it had been
i knew that
so that evening
good luck to you
you have been all right
i told him
he shook his head
i do not want anything
if you had like
the butterfly was his sailboat
before you go
climb the tower
with the exception of rein
these four years later
which was good
spyglass at my side
it was a cold
the trees were dark
dark things darted among them
and then i recognized it
it was myself
let him blind me
shadows dark and grim
only the dangerous
at the time
now that i did
so be it
in the meantime
hoisted some canvas
and set sail
an almost immortal place
not any longer
as i sailed into shadow
the note said
i am coming
i will be back
and it was signed
lord of amber
and the ship slowly turned
i moved in that direction
and this was good
but i was improving
in that order
i located the path
i took it
after a time
it was here now
i continued for several hours
then i rested awhile
then moved on
the live ones
the dark earth
how i treasured my eyes
i went on
my face creased
my form sparse
as i walked
walked in shadow
moved toward a place
here is what happened
he wore no armor
his gray eyes were open
from beneath shaggy brows
i moved nearer
i knew him
or someone very like him
i am a friend
he hesitated a moment
he drank and coughed
drank some more
i thank you
damn this cut
i have some of that
use it all
if you have to
on second thought
your hand looks shaky
it was nasty-looking
he had other
and i poured
his entire body jerked
one great spasm
i tied it there
want another drink
i asked him
he had not recognized me
we had never really met
this wounded man and i
but in a peculiar sense
we were acquainted
i was walking in shadow
seeking a place
a very special place
it had been destroyed once
and such was my heritage
alternate universes if you would
i call them shadows
in a sense
we create it
i had sailed
i had lived there
it is a long
proud and painful story
i have become somewhat chickenhearted
but perhaps the shadow earth
mellowed me a bit
i do not know
i might hear myself reviled
then i would cut out
no harm done
i sat there
and after several hours
unstoppering my canteen
have another drink
he extended a hand
i watched him drink
i know you
he demoted me
i told him
eat all you want
what of yourself
i have already eaten
while you were asleep
i looked about me
i do not understand
where are you headed
i have friends
or the devil himself
and i could stand
drew my blade
i did it again
you swing a deadly blade
it would seem
i asked him
what of the dead
they stink already
they fought well
i have not a spade
side by side
i heard him mumbling something
so i worked quickly
i cursed then
when i had finished
where do we go
head back to the trail
how do you propose to
cradle and all
then i said
clean living and all
he was staring upward
almost dropping him
if such is the case
through the stretcher
that is doubtless the case
i was asleep
around two leagues
i had say
and you are not tired
as i reckoned it
i asked him
wardens of the circle
but men possessed
now pray to god
wardens of the circle
he took a deep breath
but the circle widens
skirted the circle
and went your way
the trail began winding upward
asked my charge
that is our destination
i did not want to
but i did
while not very likely
it was possible
is a function of shadow
or perhaps he did
i have learned
is doing it
in any case
i felt sure
he knew nothing of shadow
so i trudged forward
what form did they take
a cool breeze began
dismissing rising notions of pursuit
as of footfalls
i set the stretcher down
there were two of them
my blade raised
the voice was not human-sounding
it was too highpitched
yet still it lives
said the second
sounding much like the first
slay it here
said the first
come find out
it is thin
and perhaps it is old
rapidly and without rest
let us flank it
as i turned
yanking it free
the other swept past me
heading toward the stretcher
i swung wildly
the other was burning also
i die the final death
and so i know you
why do you slay us
picked up the stretcher
ignored all questions
and continued on
what it had meant
and then i awaken
wet and shivering
and the night seems darker
and a drawbridge
which was raised
tickling the bellies of low
occluding the early stars
i stood before the drawbridge
and called out
i squinted upward
who is there
the voice came down
big and booming
who is wounded
who bore him here
then the guard called down
you may enter
not at all
there was no hostility present
i had entered a large
i could smell sweat
and the odors of cooking
as for battle
come this way
on the second floor
with a sprinkling of white
he looked at me
put him on my bed
tend to him
which relieved me somewhat
where did you find him
who are you
he studied me too closely
i spoke slowly
and with a slight falter
and lightened by dust
brotherhood of man
and all that
you are a foreigner
so i did
i am sorry
i heard myself saying
it was a big
about fourteen hours long
in the morning
i ached all over
i bathed myself
those days were gone
with that resolve
it was really around lunchtime
for a long while
as i stood watching
one swordsman raised his hand
lowered his blade
mopped his brow
and stepped back
i moved forward
i was watching you
i asked him
i tried several other languages
but none of them worked
removed my cloak
the big fellow attacked
i parried and attacked
he parried and riposted
i parried the riposte
after five minutes
he learned both very quickly
after fifteen minutes
his grin widened
he had stamina
i will say that
after twenty minutes
after twenty-five minutes
he was sheathed in sweat
but he continued on
like an asthmatic
if you are curious
it was me
we could have gone on
he was only human
after about half an hour
so was i
the horrible thing was
i felt it
i found myself slightly heady
but i needed more
and do it again
after a time
i borrowed a bow
for a time
with their lances
i moved on
then i did feel beat
i wondered about lance
after perhaps ten minutes
i thanked him
said i would be there
returned to my chamber
green boots and belt
sat in a high-backed chair
he rose as i entered
clasping my hand
looking at you
of big stones
how is lance feeling today
i will drink to that
the circle and its wardens
lance mentioned it
he finally asked
there we sat down
the silver towers were fallen
into a sea of blood
the silver towers are fallen
when he did
his voice was altered
there was such a place
i lived there
i asked him
but nobody knows it
i have spoken with sorcerers
he misquoted my lyric
i am sorry
but i do not
far to the east
across the waters
it is an island kingdom
i shook my head
looking at me once more
i sipped my wine
i was an arms instructor
to the royal guard
but if it is so
he drained his wineglass
against these demons
begging your pardon
but i know of him
several years ago
who held the city
he deserved better
said the man
we came to a battlement
seating ourselves on the stone
sucking in the evening air
one by one
in the darkening sky
far off in the distance
i heard a night bird
from somewhere below us
he filled it
and struck a flame
i smelled the smoke
after a time
i became the leader
mine was the highest
he spoke more rapidly now
he shook his head
one later day
i became an officer
we won the battles
put down the uprising
and i remained
at his court
those were the good years
but these we always won
i had wanted that dukedom
i was furious
where something was always stirring
many of my men died
before they could be routed
i hoped they would
with his foxy tactics
i would not bow
but to no avail
when i awakened
he rode along
jibing at me the while
then he pronounced my exile
released me in this place
and rode away
which had gone out
many a bruising
only barely preserving my life
at that point
so unhorsing him
was a good life
this lasted for several years
stared off into the distance
far to the west
but did not die
in the twilight
as of small fires
throughout the night
a few remained
more and more people remained
fought with them
they slew wantonly
after many months
like the hellcats you slew
in this fashion
the old king
who had long hunted me
from ocean to ocean
he really died
then he sat up
as he burned
his form changed
and snakes and hopping things
so i agreed
then i fell ill
three had died
told them the story
and they were enlisted
in the years that followed
the circle grew
we fought many skirmishes
we lost a few battles
i wanted my captain
and it is strange here
i had known a lancelot
just like him
it is strange
at any rate
i hate it
but here i am
now it is mine
i asked him
there was silence
he emptied his pipe
he refilled it
he puffed it
there was more silence
i do not know
i once did
this is different
god damn it
could not lance lead them
i had say so
but there is another reason
i think that goat-thing
whatever it was
on the altar
but i did
we fought for a time
which was a good thing
for it was winning
it spoke again
as we swaggered swords
but when morning came
slaying them as they fled
for all your strength
do not ask me why
it was not necessary
it was only a bird
a white bird
making small noises
i unfastened it
crumpled it in my hand
what is the matter
written in my own hand
what is it
i handed it to him
i am coming
and it bore my signature
and he would come here
so it would seem
this is very strange
dismissing the bird
which cooed twice
i do not understand
perhaps he could destroy it
i told him
a cruel one
he shook his head again
that is not his style
sleep on it
stifling a yawn
we said our good nights
chapter 2 day
a brown one
the country was called lorraine
and so was she
and passed her by
and i said
as i passed her
i kept running into her
and then something else happened
slightly pointed chin
her voice was somewhat nasal
her hair was too long
her complexion too freckled
but i liked her
as i said
so we had gone there
i had become a captain
do not we all
how old are you
how old are you
neither would a lady
when you first came here
i did not think so
but your beard fooled everyone
beards often do that
you look better every day
if i ask you nicely
i had tell you so
but i had be lying
i am afraid not
i had rather talk
have a glass of wine
aptitude and good teachers
stories grow with the telling
but i have watched you
they like you
why do i frighten them
because i am strong
but i try harder
who is he
a supernatural creature
benedict of amber
is he one
if he is still alive
are you a supernatural creature
i poured them
i mean here
fighting this thing
why do you say that
then why stick around
were you born around here
in the wood
the fairy ring
i am sorry
i am not
you may be right
nobody knew for sure
that might prove interesting
if you killed him
i have to
she finished her wine
so i poured her another
put on armor tomorrow
pick up a lance
get hold of a horse
he beat me last week
can you do it
consider him trounced
i love you
i like you
someone was looking for me
it could not be random
which i doubted
they could go to hell
and our sisters
so i resisted discovery
you are not drunk yet
and neither am i
i saw a face
it was an old man
i slapped her then
you are lying
you could not have
do not hit me
who was he
i sometimes get them
do not worry about it
you are lying to me
why should i
because you like me
i told her
for a second
lorraine whimpered slightly
neither do i
go bar the door
as she did this
i reseated myself
my blade across my knees
what are we doing
i am not positive
she shuddered and drew near
perhaps you had better leave
i shook my head
what a beautiful blade
there is not another
not much of it
then she was silent again
and i asked her
what do you mean
if i had not
i wanted a pretty daughter
and i made that happen
i do not understand
i thought you knew
i am afraid not
i thought you knew
i am sorry
how do you know
have not you
do not you
so do i
i feel that
who i am
i do not know
i think not
i do not know
if i destroy the servant
whichever way it works out
she asked me
names you what
i think it might
do not be afraid
i am afraid
and you will hurt me
i know it
but i want you
why do i want you
i do not know
sounding slightly hysterical
as a cold
behind the bed
i dropped mine quickly
and it had gray
it held a short
with its left hand
it clutched at the lattice
enter at your peril
i said loudly
it would know me
when it spoke
you are not the one
it could be his
who are you
who are you
conjure with it
who are you
who are you
it said again
none of your business
fly away home
who are you
come on in and burn
i lunged forward
then i sprang back
the creature saw well enough
but then so am i
we circled the room
cold droplets lashed my face
you burn prettily
and my opportunity was there
i ran it through
it howled then
but did not fall
it stood there wearing them
then it lunged
and stepping forward
as hard as i could
it leaped for the blade
chin against my breast
as my death grip tightened
its eyes sought mine
so i did
oh my father
what have i wrought
i said within my heart
i looked down upon it-charred-seeming
and smelling of decay
and perhaps succeed
how far north
three or four leagues
they move about a bit
a perpetual thunderhead
rode above the circle
though the storm never broke
patting his stomach
and lighting his pipe
or will he not
where is he
it was probably a joke
i ca not
what is it
my old liege
saying he is coming
i had thought him dead
but he sent this message
and i held my breath
forget his message
and his promise means nothing
you know him
i know of him
he ruled in this land
they are the same
in days before my days
that was not true
or was it
because of my presence there
that is interesting
he was a sorcerer
how did it occur
none of your business
we lit up
he did the smart thing
we did not
just sitting there
maybe you could do it
unless i got lucky
i may be fooling myself
perhaps i have grown soft
should we attack
he did not
it would not be easy
so we did that thing
we rode north that afternoon
after their fashion
and they drilled
we had about twenty-five hundred
they also had weird flying
we had stout hearts
and it would be decided
one way or another
the whole thing
but it was true
i had done it
if i could
in a fit of passion
compounded of rage
i had unleashed this thing
the wardens of the circle
the verdict was
we fell to planning
as i lay with lorraine
if she would agree
she did not
i will stay with you
i would not have
but that was her affair
and later we slept
she had had a dream
in the morning
she said to me
i had a dream
the coming battle
she told me
i do not know
but as you slept
i wish you had not
in this time
my place is here
she told me
i do believe you
but i will not go
you are a damned fool
let me stay
as you wish
you are a damned fool
i love you
and a stupid one
the word is like
you will do it
go to hell
then she wept
that was lorraine
chapter 3 i thought back
which i knew was wrong
but they had been brief
we made our camp
we slept undisturbed
i shaved my beard
then i dressed
dark as soil
today would be the day
i donned my visor
put on chain mail
buckled my belt
i kissed lorraine
then i mounted my horse
a roan named star
we are ready
turned and rode away
lighting his pipe
how is your arm
you have shaved your beard
good fortune to us all
i know no gods
i welcome them
there is but one god
lighting his pipe
it will be ours
let us be about it
my sections were ready
we filed down the hillside
nothing stirred within it
and no troops were visible
he is with us
i told him
then nodded brusquely
when we had assembled
give the order
and lance drew his blade
echoed about us
a dark cavalry appeared
and we met them
after five minutes
then we heard the thunder
there was lightning
the thunderhead had finally broken
barred our way
we held out
that slew us-grayfaced
i wanted more
i was not sure
we topped a rise
i raised my blade
as we descended
a portable electric chair
to my right
prayers for the dead
to my left
through the flashing lightning
the citadel loomed larger
when we reached the gate
they outnumbered us
but we had little choice
but i thought not
as i saw it
was all important now
laying about him
cross when you can
i am with you
they pressed us
mixed in with human troops
defending ourselves on all sides
we won through
or each other
he would be there
in the highest tower
and face him down
i tried it
you have come too far
or are you mortal man
did he name you
and he did
he turned to me
this is the thing
what is it
stay away from it
you are welcome to it
he stood stock still
did you really mean that
asked the creature
and leaped forward
like a thunderbolt
a deafening response
the lightning responded
for an instant
in that moment
our eyes met
then we both struck
and we both reeled back
lord of amber
it said then
it struck again
its speed was deadly
it was saying
you gave us this gateway
help us now
if i would help
if i held the city
do we have a bargain
came the sharp
i thought upon the shadows
then i hurled it
with all my strength
mine sure hurt
and i turned my head
sword across his knees
lorraine was with him
how goes it
we have won
he told me
you have kept your promise
when you killed that thing
it was all over
the men fell senseless
the creatures burned
have you reached any conclusions
i do not know
i smiled at lorraine
the death has already begun
not returning my smile
what do you mean
that was not me
i am what i am
what was it
ignoring her departure
through the shadows to amber
the path was the circle
you may rest easy here
i shook my head
take me with you
are you mad
no matter what the peril
should i lose this time
that is true
i grew new eyes
you are a demon
this has often been said
i no longer deny it
you are mad
take me with you
beside my own
what battle is certain
i will chance it
as you would
you may come
we camped there that night
then i sought after lorraine
although she had been upset
i mounted star
and rode on after
in a way
i could not blame her
they might have been relieved
they could have my blessing
in my heart
somewhere along the way
once i held amber
i was heading north
i followed all that day
through dusk and into evening
help us now
when morning paled the sky
i mounted and continued on
i was gaining on them
when i found her
and her flesh yet warm
and her jeweled combs
i rode on
which he was
though he drew his own
i replaced her rings
before i closed the grave
and that was lorraine
lorraine and i
in the land called lorraine
will go down into darkness
perhaps even sooner than that
i now judge
until that time
chapter 4 riding
through the wild
white isles of night
i sang as we rode
and after a time
as i walked
i heard it again
the man hung from it
it is difficult
he did not hang limply
but swung back and forth
i knew that i
as his body slowed
the boy cried out
from his complexion
at the last moment
tell me everything
said the other
i know no more
i could not seel
why did you not follow
they were mounted
i was on foot
i was dazed
you were afraid
cried the youth
the boy screamed
i was afraid
and you fled then
i kept running
he moved the blade again
said the boy
i stepped forward then
lowering the blade
the boy sought my eyes
what have we here
what do you mean
who was fighting
it sounds somewhat familiar
lovely and cold
armed and armored
eyes like ice
mounted on white
killing all others
following their van
it seems strange
i went on
stronger than before
the boy was ashen
whom he calls the protector
routed them many times
i am not certain
but nothing came of this
i asked him
then nodded slowly
free his hands
well feed him
but that was different
i got away with it
it broke me up completely
he looked irritated
then he began laughing himself
and he stooped
presented me with several complications
i saw no real choice
one way or another
sooner or later
they could not be avoided
we go on
you will be slain
i decided against it
i should imagine
but he will not
you know that
he shrugged again
but we encountered no one
while quite brief
there were no horn notes
the complaint of a squirrel
the bark of a fox
the plash of a waterfall
and several fire-charred groves
or that of their conqueror
it was a clear
i bathed there
standing on the bank
traced the edges of clouds
the distant mountains
the farthest trees
held it a moment
there will doubtless be sentries
we are simply two travelers
we look the part
then we are poor targets
the way was not straight
and wandered for a time
then took an upward turn
the trees thinned even more
sporadically wooded area
do not move
and i saw four men
on this side
who are you
where are you from
we are mercenaries
and we are seeking employment
it is yours
and if i said no
in that case
should we have
remove your weapons
we have seen nothing unusual
they will probably feed you
remove your weapons now
the men took our weapons
i turned back toward him
what is your name
he asked me
drawing very near
what is the matter
instead of replying
he told me
you struck me as familiar
does not he
he addressed the nearest bowman
he said then
one of those old men
before my time
i do not remember
which was just as well
leather and oil
i watched the big tent
sipped my tea
talking among themselves
glancing back within
still facing the interior
as they drifted farther outside
after a time they did
he stepped outside then
his trousers brown
i stood quickly
our gazes met
he seldom smiled
come with me
we followed him
a small table
a campaign chest
as well as books
and some cups
and still alive
and breathing yet
it has been devilish long
who is your friend
he passed one to me
raised the third himself
to your health
the sobriquet is not unearned
he said flatly
enough of that
where have you been
what have you been doing
why have you come here
tell me of yourself
it has been too long
it was unfortunate
he was my elder
it had been
as he had said
there must be a beginning
he said then
there are many beginnings
it is difficult
the lamp danced and sputtered
benedict said softly
as i was saying
nothing that formal
at any rate
as though he understood
i went on
when i awakened
and i had contracted it
i traveled all over it
i attended their universities
i consulted famous physicians
the years passed
keeping watch over me
desiring my death
i find it strange
just the two of us
people do change
but it is possible
he nodded again
the hell he did
there was no abdication
he just vanished
there were no messages
he only nodded
for all i knew
but i keep in touch
my mind raced
somewhere to the south
who did that leave
as i saw it
on the other hand
julian hated me
it is interesting
in this light
i felt my face redden
he nodded curtly
please continue your telling
at this time
how do you know this
then random showed up
fleeing from something
i never found out why
back in my cell
pursued by furies
in the first place
it had crossed my mind
the opportunity was there
and i took it
it proved effective
at this point
i left him behind
in flight from amber
she remained behind
it was almost empty
i took a long swallow
in the palace
i went on
there in the library
neither do i
i had heard that
how was it done
i think so
i would say
he leaned back
and smiled faintly
not for a long while
and he was obviously mad
but he could be manipulated
on the other hand
kindly old man
he had simply walked out
the very absence of shadow
and had left his quarters
before he returned to them
where i recovered somewhat
as i understood it
i had almost forgotten
he never encouraged intimacy
he tolerated us
the thirteen of us
of whom i had heard
long before us
who had not survived
so far as i knew
but he was secretive
there was in him
an element of uneasiness
he occasionally spoke
his secret commitments
i was afraid of him
and not without cause
i asked myself
i answered myself
regarding my handiwork
after i recovered my sight
then came here
for whatever it was worth
and of your escape
how did you manage that
i had help
not at all
what are your plans now
they are still uncertain
i do not know
i am in charge
not a boast
if i am correct
the price was high
who slew their leader
i asked him
i managed it
when i looked back
we looked for you
did you know that
we tried your trump repeatedly
but there was no response
that is interesting
and random joined the search
i am astonished
i said then
and smiled myself
and so did i
perhaps i was becoming oversensitive
can we be old friends
i smiled and nodded
for the raids
for that matter
would he support him
throw his weight behind me
finished my wine
poured some more
what are your long-range plans
he asked me
i would deny it
at this time
alive and distressed
it is as i said
he told me
then you would support him
it clarifies matters
this being the case
i do not know
what do you mean
i have no army
he reddened faintly and nodded
it pleases me
any major reports
no new deaths
we both chuckled
i believe that it was
and in the meantime
i am sure
i seldom do
and we finished the wine
as we left his tent
he glanced that way
returned the nod
makes no difference to me
i was tired
instead of closing my eyes
filled my pipe again
and struck it to life
dropped back for an instant
but he remained alone
i told myself
everything will be all right
the mill was deserted today
it was somewhat hypnotic
we were well received
it would have been refreshing
it should work out neatly
as i saw it
each with his allotted section
his face darkened
and i saw lorraine then
she was gesturing
and calling my name
i leaned toward her
seeing her clearly
it came again
i turned quickly and stared
a mask in her left
her teeth were white
even and a trifle long
who the devil are you
just then noticing a jacket
not till we have fenced
i picked up the blade
pulled on the mask
drawing her out
she laughed and came on
pressing me hard
she almost got through twice
she cursed softly
she did not tire readily
our blades clicking steadily
i felt momentarily confused
but i smiled
before i could say anything
i am hungry
i am also curious
she said merrily
after my grandmother
because that is your name
i recognized you
she released my arm
here it is
gesturing downstream with her head
why way back there
you are probably right
the first time
you were sound asleep
come and sit down now
and open the bottle
as i opened the bottle
and i poured
she raised her glass
to the reunion
do not be so prosaic
and took a drink
to the reunion
so i did too
was it some great court
perhaps it was in amber
there you were
just who are you
admired by all the ladies
admiring you from afar
that was not it
i was drunk that night
it was a part-time job
i give up
and i poured more wine
what is he to you
she laughed again
it was possible
i am hurt
you are his daughter
are not you
but she shook her head
but you are getting close
i am the only one
both of them
how did they die
you know that i can
do not you
it explained several things
are not you
so i did
how did you recognize me
took a drink of wine
from your picture
on the card
i knew that
that is why i
where does he keep them
she narrowed her eyes
focusing them on my own
i have not asked him
i told her
do you understand their significance
they are quite important
are not they
i thought so
do you have a set
but for very dull
i shook my head
you are afraid of him
a better swordsman
i looked away
have it as you would
where have you been
in the mountains
i do not
i have been there before
the place has no name
as well as the village
but the mountains are different
the sky is different -everything
once i am there
but i just got lost
i do not have to
i know benedict
how does he do it
i shook my head
how did you do it
i asked her
her brows were furrowed
i do not really know
with her left hand
finally picking it up
i was mad
i do not know how
and suddenly we were there
i know this area
i was born here
i grew up here
i have ridden all over
with the knife
i waited till nightfall
she went on
it was an unreal feeling
the stars were all different
for the next several days
rode until noon
then headed back
it was totally bewildering
after about a week
i began having dreams
that is not completely right
i set out
still half dreaming
is that not strange
i sat down beside her
i asked her
give me that knife
she passed it to me
with its point
rubbing some out
when i had finished
she spoke very softly
that is it
how did you know
i do not know
i am not certain
i do not think so
he was always evasive
it lies in all directions
or any direction one chooses
one need but
i had forgotten
what does it mean
when was brand here
teach me games
eight or nine years ago
i had say
just a few months back
i suddenly felt very insecure
i am too
she made a spitting noise
i do not need protecting
you are a fine fencer
i know that
i am not a child
you are joking
are not you
i do not know
i guess not
never trust a relative
you really mean that
do not you
trust me in all things
and i laughed
you would not hurt us
i know that
still studying me
have not i
you are right
where is the village
they are somehow alike
are not they
what are shadows
i held out my hand
but she took it
but i stopped her
when the sun appeared again
its light came more yellow
the bird cries grew hoarser
and we frightened a large
interspersed with ferns
moving up this trail
saying nothing now
there were big
across from us
perhaps half a mile distant
a gigantic wheel slowly rotated
ponderous and gleaming
conversation was impossible
which was just as well
after a time
that she spoke
and like amber
amber casts shadow
if you know how
that place was a shadow
that is what i did
coming back from the village
i can do it
do anything i want
the ability lies within you
she kissed me then
then rotated away
then i can do anything
coming to a standstill
there are limitations
that is life
it is quite large
if you stop
it will destroy you
i followed more slowly
as i drew near
i must walk it now
amber is barred to you
it is not fair
of course not
do not blame me
part of the blame
benedict will know
he will tell you then
to what end
that he cares for you
when the time is ready
and if he does not
will you help me then
the family trumps
get hold of mine
stare at it
concentrate on it
how does it work
a thing for a thing
five or six months ago
and suddenly he just stopped
lowered the clippers
he ignored me
leading two spare horses
he was wearing his blade
his left leg was broken
julian was quite battered also
and they healed quickly
where did it happen
on the black road
where is this black road
i do not know
they cursed it a lot
that was all
passed her one
to the reunion
and we drank
give me three months
where will you be then
i should be back tomorrow
i wish that i could
i would like to
to the stables
i will be leaving immediately
she picked up the basket
we will go together then
my horse is this way
grandpa in particular
that would be prudent
much of the time
once this begins
so i moved slowly
using my discretion
sometimes going completely berserk
my way was shaded
i bore west
moved through the narrow streets
entered and departed shops
flocks of birds wheeled
and of clanking
seeing it from up there
those days were passed
that thing done with
i turned and continued southward
i do not forget
the sun became a dazzling
then long shadows
the dying of the wind
the temperature plummeting
our pace steady
two hundred meters
its bottommost edge plowing
a burst of speed
staining the ground
now a steady flow
streamlets all about us
high ground ahead
bunching and relaxing beneath me
plunges through a racing
and strikes the slope
the voice of the gurgling
toward clover fields and evening
twisting along our trail
jostling one another about me
as dry as dust
of the italian alps
star bewildered and snorting
so shadows beyond the rock
a gentler slope
a drying wind
a twisting trail
a corkscrew trail
an adit into warmth
down the night
beneath the changing stars
wheeling above the carrion feast
to every star its double
the air above it
filled with fleeting shapes
ticks and grows still
impressions of a sleeping jungle
somewhere a river with broad
thud of hoofs
shuttling of shadows
the air is sweetened
we are merged
star and i
neck clothed in thunder
swallowing the ground
then among them
droplets of moisture
spider web in the moonlight
struggling shapes within
a clear space
long grasses rustling
the grassy chuckling of water
beside it at last
and the trees
with a cold
pacing it now
easy and flowing
splashing in its shallows
drinking like a pump
blasting spray from his nostrils
it laps at my boots
dripping from my hair
running down my arms
at the laughter
then downriver again
sloping downward now
and fewer trees
dim hint of the sea
lost an odor later
and an absence of trees
flashing between walls of stone
deeper the defile
gentler the slope
the touch of salt
shale and grit
around a comer
and brighter still
soft and loose the footing
the breeze and the light
the breeze and the light
beyond a crop of rock
here and there
and alive with shadows
it was right
it was the hard
white light i had sought
was the necessary place
no x-ray machines
or armed guards
none of these things here
unlike any conventional mine
as i worked the dunes
i had shrugged
in other words
of course not
that was ridiculous
out of the question
did i say
a raised hand
within a week
about the diamonds
before i left his shop
something had been worked out
which of course is incorrect
it burns rapidly
with typical family foresight
it was much later
during a visit to amber
the quantity involved was small
it made an excellent primer
straight from the container
rather than being scorched
i remember that day
i had already crowned myself
and been beaten for it
i threw it at you
such a beautiful thing
all of silver
with its seven high points
you crowned yourself that day
all arrogance and hasty pomp
before the echoes of
long live the king
had died within the hall
now you reign in amber
i said aloud
but i have my eyes
wrap yourself in the kingship
stay behind them
i am coming
i will have it all
i uncovered another rough diamond
the sixteenth or so
i wondered about benedict
what was the connection
it was julian
then my danger was great
i could understand
even sympathize with
the walling of my prison
the digging of my grave
on whatever hillside he hunted
he had come home
i would keep my promise
he would come with me
tramp about the countryside
sail upon the rivers
i thought about the girl
i was not certain how
she would learn eventually
they died violently
she had said
was it possible
when i returned
i gnashed my teeth
when i ruled in amber
things would be different
i washed away the dust
as i bathed
as it was
my bath was undisturbed
it was still dark
i tended star
who had grown somewhat wild
i needed some rest
the manor was dark
i poured a stiff one
tossed it off
the moon stands blank above
so it does
so it does
i said softly
not turning from the window
how drunk are you
hardly at all
carried it to him
he raised it slowly
nodded his thanks
took a sip
you were in a fight
but i won
i came in feeling jolly
then she picked me up
then she let me fall
he took another drink
and i chuckled
he said ruefully
she accepted your apology
and said that she would
i was waiting up
did you tell her anything
striking a light
and i can see why
a very good reason
thanks for telling me
your welfare is my welfare
it was the same place
the field of thorns
if we live trough amber
that was from you
in happier times
of the promenades
the morning had begun
i said slowly
i must have been very
i said nothing
i think that it will
reach amber with reinforcements
rather than tear amber apart
i am certain
i do not believe so
he and i
i doubt that very much
he laughed then
better than i served you
sipped my drink
it would be tricky
i believe you
but would he
i am sorry
you do not understand
but this is not so
i fear benedict
a thousand years
several of them
commanding a small militia
do not be deceived
with but slightly altered circumstances
if he were
i fear benedict
and i took another drink
i did not realize this
he said then
that much he will do
may i see them
they are in the rough
he passed it back
that should prove some compensation
obtain our cargo
the greater our head start
finished his drink
he said then
we had best rest now
he rose to his feet
picked up the decanter carefully
then pointed down the path
down in it
there is a fresh grave
it was quite shallow
how recently dead
a few days
i had judge
i am not a fool
but this troubles me considerably
what were they like
how did they die
nothing special about them
you go ahead
turning back toward the manor
see you in the morning
he was right
i rose then and strolled
as i reckoned it
sat down upon it
and pulled off my boots
not too much longer
i was on my way
now i was free
and had a plan
the feeling was good
as was the grass
i cleaned my pipe
put it away
i detected a distant movement
then it advanced toward me
apparently aware of this
she smiled in my direction
slowing as she came near
not at all
despite the rain
i spent it out
but i did not sleep
where have you been
down by the seaside
since we walked in shadow
i would imagine
you were right
i must get to amber
and walk the pattern
you are young
there is plenty of time
take me to amber
let me walk the pattern
i am an outlaw
if i am lucky
given sufficient provocation
i believe that he would
when did this occur
several years ago
and i will
it is rightly mine
he made the mistake
neither did i
for that matter
but he is your brother
i assure you
and if you fail
you must win
would grandpa support you
i doubt it
and of yours
i will be satisfied
and if i am quick
he will not oppose me
i have charmed you
in your own delicate way
grandpa is coming back tomorrow
what will he do
what should i tell him
as to your status
as to my whereabouts
up to a point
i shook my head
the same conflicts exist everywhere
in various forms
they are all about you
one day you will
then tell me another thing
you were lucky
i will even help
i guess i can wait
i guess you can
no hard feelings
smile gone and lips parting
eyes almost closed
as we kissed
if benedict ever found out
chapter 7 the wagon creaked
back among the cases
and heading into the northeast
we moved along a dry
and the trees were short
their barks thick and shaggy
star and firedrake walked steadily
i needed the wagon
not its heat
but it was worth it
you ca not have everything
i wanted more daylight
i rubbed my eyes
i took several deep breaths
after a time
we mounted a long
the sky was quite dark
i winced at the thought
on its other side
the road was smoother
as we proceeded
it grew darker
it had begun raining
my head ached
we rattled on
because i kept nodding
as from a great distance
i focused my concentration
birds queried the day
i put on the brake
and located a water bottle
as i drank
leave a drop for me
you are taking over now
i told him
but bide a moment
he stepped off the road
is it morning
he called back to me
i did a little shadow-shifting
i do not understand
but never mind
i believe you
where are we now
still heading northeast
we have moved through shadow
just keep following the road
we need the distance
could benedict still reach us
i think so
when should i raise you
he was silent then
a moment later
because i felt somewhat guilty
that was why
that was not it
all this was true
i wrestled with it
i cared for the girl
it was quite different
i had forgotten the feeling
not at all
she was a child
i had already done
it was all wrong
i should not let myself
the wagon jounced and creaked
took a turn uphill
when i awoke
there was greenery about us
hard-packed and fairly smooth
the sky was clear
there was a light breeze
back among the living
the horses are getting tired
are not you
for any special reason
leading even higher
facing to the left
and shaded his eyes
come up here
i took it
where i stood beside him
and i followed the gesture
was a wide
i would say
there were trees within it
and they were totally black
like currents in a flat
what is it
i shook my head slowly
i was quite drowsy
then edged away again
the black road
the black road
another ill omen
i am afraid so
i do not believe so
but i am not certain
i took the reins again
still in a talkative mood
what is it
should i hurry
keep it normal
no one home
this property is vacant
do not disturb
trespassers will be prosecuted
beware of dog
slippery when wet
then came on again
and i blocked it again
there followed a third wave
i stopped that one
then it was gone
massaged my eyeballs
it was almost certainly benedict
pretty fair now
i had say
i guided us on
i bit my lip
it was altogether different
it was unfortunate
that road and i
gradually moving closer together
our paths finally intersected
i drew rein
it was a long
here and there
was several shades darker
with a smeared
sooty tone to it
holding its breath
then we heard a scream
beyond those hills
it smelled fishy
it could be real
it was a monochromatic sight
save for the flames
all in white
black hair hanging loose
down to her waist
half a dozen hairy
muttering and chuckling
i rushed forward
leaping over the long
and charged into the group
shouting as they swung them
their juices were black
holding my breath
she fell into my arms
her lack of one
she wore a full
oval and curving
she clung to me
and she was surprisingly strong
it is all right now
but she did not reply
her desirability was enhanced
from instant to instant
it is all right now
who are you
why were they burning you
who were they
but she did not reply
she had stopped sobbing
although in a different way
while some cold
but she restrained me
child of amber
a steady stream of profanities
and four final
amber must be destroyed
his legs twisted unnaturally
i ran toward him
the black grasses
over which i had leaped
and tossed away the mask
catching him under the arms
the stuff resisted fiercely
i carried him then
green variety beyond the road
they are numb
my legs are asleep
they are tingling
they are coming along now
we go across
keep your blade handy
we entered the black area
remote though near at hand
they were odorless
we rounded the hill
miasmal prospect was unaltered
i grew angry then
the mists thickened
outlines grew indistinct
i shook the reins
the horses moved faster
everything else did
the ground shook
cracking in places
a green bough
a sparkle of water
a glimpse of blue sky
faces behind a window
a piece of star-filled sky
mechanical-washed over us
but i determined
that was worse
i think so
the world was brighter here
the soil was darker
our way curved
ran back a bit
sinister self once more
how are your legs now
looking back along our trail
i see a horseman
coming very fast
i stood and turned
i cursed then
i think so
we will find out
real soon now
when we had passed it
within a few moments
i leveled us quickly
that was what it took
we raced on
pouring light upon the land
we bore to the right
regained the sun
winding among tall
featureless stands of blue-gray stone
the horses raced
narrowly missing us
running in steaming
the ground trembled
the wagon swayed and shimmied
bumping and shuddering
across the plain itself
dancing in the troubled air
he was shouting something
the air was turbulent
filled with dust
i made for it
an enormous cavern mouth
turned a corner
and came into a wide
eerie beauty of the place
faint and echoing
if it was benedict
we proceeded onward and upward
the tremors ceased
small birds darted above us
low opening onto day
passing among gigantic trees
vanishing within them
they are very tired now
one way or another
have you noticed it
off to the right
turning my head
perhaps a mile distant
all of them
it would seem
i shook my head slowly
i hope not
we proceeded downward
he was pushing it hard
there is always that possibility
shifting slowly and imperceptibly
when the time is right
we achieved level terrain
about an hour later
leaping to my feet
i do not believe it
what do we do now
we rolled once more
without killing him
except for the black road
benedict would barely notice him
i shifted slightly again
the woods are on fire
i laughed and looked back
of their own accord
the horses increased their pace
i fought a moment
i cursed and we ran
i drew on the reins
gently at first
and they stood there quivering
it was a good
and perhaps that black
blasted slice of land
i will meet him here
we will be continuing on
if they are not
surrender immediately to benedict
he will do it
i told him
do as i said
he looked at me
i backed off the trail
burning branches falling
it was benedict all right
his face partly muffled
if i did that
he rode straight toward me
his garments were filthy
his face blackened
black and red
eyes fixed upon me
he departed the road
bearing slightly toward my left
the blade was a long
full understanding of death itself
the moment was gone
i backed into the grove
moist nostrils flaring
it turned aside
tearing up turf
then slowly toppled
but as he advanced
he swung the weapon
back and forth
in a normal voice
she is an adult now
he just kept coming
slowing only slightly
come no farther
i simply parried
and stepped behind a tree
i do not understand
he said again
seeking openings everywhere
there were none
at least tell me
with anybody else
he drove me steadily back
he was too fast
benedict twisted to his right
swept him off his feet
and threw him at me
as i stepped aside
moving momentarily out of range
then leaned forward and attacked
and very fast
one unexpected result
was that i got through
for an instant
it could even be distracting
just for a moment
backing out of the grove
parrying and retreating
he drove in
as he had before
they were very rough moments
as he did
then the strain
it had him
so i moved immediately
i danced to the right
he swayed for a moment
but retained his balance
pointing the blade at me
it stunned him
this time with my fist
seized benedict under the armpits
the grasses resisted mightily
looking down at benedict
what a fellow he is
what a fellow he is
will you bring the blades
while he did this
i did not look back
he has not moved yet
with one hand yet
he will be all right
i climbed down
i riffled through them
inlaid with bone
after a time
it grew warm
he was in amber
he halted and stared
you are looking well
you can see
i can see again
where are you
his gaze tightened
it is benedict
he is in trouble
he is unable to
he is restrained
he needs your help
and you think i can
i know you can
then he nodded
i am coming to you
he stood for a moment
then took a step forward
he stood beside me
i looked away
so am i
so am i
where is benedict
what is the problem
then why are you here
i am fleeing
he wrinkled his brow
i do not understand
i shook my head
so i summoned you
please go to him
and see him home
losing myself in shadow
i am not certain
he called me a murderer
if he mentions it
and what is it
if he does not
in other words
what are you planning
what do you think
the answer is obvious
we are always victorious
for you then
but not necessarily for amber
as i said
we are always victorious
the road goes on
that is why
and your plans
but they are unchanged
but i wish you well
he clasped my hand
not by me
i will try
then good-by for now
a burned-out shell
a car in the driveway
i lit a cigarette
for this reason
what it is
this keeps them looking honest
they come high
he had kept asking
will be my problem
let me worry about it
some dozen years before
i am not certain
no good at all
during our talk
as he spoke no english
for that matter
did he really care
he followed my instructions
after some more discussion
i read the newspapers
it does not matter
confidence is a fine thing
then there is foolhardiness
the ultimate arbiter
he told me
i told him no
i reminded him
then he nodded
he overcharged me
as i had suspected
the silver came high
and i could afford it
for that matter
around seven acres
the whole hillside
i had liked it
it would be gone
i kept watching
i was in no hurry
one way or the other
if i did
he had said
what happened with benedict
his horse was very tired
then borrowed a horse
that calculating look
you really do not know
if i knew
i would not ask
they were murdered
he says you did it
that is ridiculous
i do not understand
where were the bodies
but not too deeply
he is puzzled
and very puzzled yourself
he dropped his eyes
he met my gaze
there is more to it
what is that
you must be joking
i want an answer
is that all
i do not like julian
i do not trust him
so i called you
back when you summoned me
what is the matter
i got it
and i cleared out
you saw that wagon
fast and light
what was in the wagon
he can find out
if he must
it is immaterial
but is in another place
then answer my question
i believe you
what about benedict
what does he think
i know that
i am going away now
what is it
how did you do it
hit it with the pattern
it is not of shadow
yes and no
i know what it is
it was no fun
but it did work
i will remember
what of amber
what of amber
i dropped my eyes
it will be no contest
do not hit amber now
i am sorry
i am sorry
i mashed a final cigarette
rose to my feet
the broken window
i descended the hill
i had debated contacting random
decided against it
it was not absolutely essential
it was five years ago
i just did not know
several weeks had passed
sidled up to a window
wiped it with my elbow
i peered in
it was a mess
ninth brick in
fourth brick up
i let myself in
there was dust on everything
there were coffee containers
i tried it
it was a total mess
i backed away
went and checked my workshop
it had been stripped
lighting a cigarette
i could not believe it
i scrutinized it
removed it from its hook
i was troubled
but that was silly
it had already been sprung
some sort of a message
had it remained unravaged
should still be the safe
pressed the panel loose
and swung it out
i did not remember it
my name upon it
written in an elegant hand
not with ballpoint either
the letter said
if you are reading this
as i see it
my only regret
vanity it was
i will be back
had i written it
i anticipate your return
knowing you for no fool
not my own
against these forces
lord of amber
i reread it and chuckled
never doubt it
as for amber
you make the mistake
of considering yourself necessary
i will wait though
i would never know
then i mounted the hill
i crossed over and down
figuring ten pounds per piece
which was not bad
we drove for hours
finally encountering the black road
paralleling it for a time
they were short fellows
but they had trigger fingers
and they worshiped me
these would be pretty safe
worse coincidences have occurred
on a bright
we halted for lunch
and continued on
the sky of amber
we bivouacked there
posting a very heavy guard
they went through several transformations
we departed the hard
it slowed us
the trees were quite large
and squirrels that day
or who was more surprised
we moved on quickly then
successfully avoiding two patrols
but there was no rainfall
and of lorraine
in the morning
heading steadily upward
i headed back immediately
a small knot of men
stood staring down at something
talking in low voices
i pushed my way through
i could not believe it
perhaps twelve feet in length
about twenty paces away
if nothing else
quite a thing
i do not really know
i have a funny
you feel it
he nodded again
and the thunder never ceased
and the winds grew stronger
we encountered another manticora later
about an hour later
we kept climbing
the winds increased in velocity
it grew quite dark
the rocks were more slippery
sentries all about the perimeter
the temperature plummeted
even had i permitted fires
there was nothing burnable about
sudden and silent
during what passed for morning
with greater numbers and persistency
shooting a few of them
things were even worse
where it halted
mounted forces swirled together
lines of foot soldiers advanced
at the conflict far below
along the black road
i had envisioned harassment
we must increase the pace
we moved again
and that helped
the storm without rain continued
about a mile farther along
i mounted a steep upturn
i suspected the latter
i moved nearer
they were still arriving
for they were airborne
but still they came on
i stared and studied
there could be no doubt
on my belly now
i crawled even farther
with his left hand
on its far side
another of my brothers
quite a while
i moved to the right
from this distance
let alone who was winning
i could see
the invaders were strong
at that moment
for that matter
it was not going well
an intriguing thought
i felt myself smiling
my own advantage was not
i could not hate thee
loved i not amber more
at its farther edge
and i recognized the horse
heading in my direction
i shouted at her
and stood before me
so i did
how did you get here
i followed grandpa
benedict is here
julian is there
is that true
she nodded again
is not it
of course it is
i will wait
the smile went away
i do not know
he was not there
i traveled quite a distance
i do that often
the next afternoon
as i was returning home
heading to the east
the way led through shadow
time got all mixed up
he came here
she gestured toward the valley
and i followed
we are going ahead now
and there will be fighting
i do not want them
i am busy
they are sufficient
i will see you later
the twilight resettled about us
i returned to it then
which ones are the enemy
they charged forward
i searched among the defenders
bring up the troops
raising my rifle
i fired again
i got another
they were quite fast
launching themselves into space
becoming airborne again
its summit lost in the
as we had advanced
we drew closer
and our firing was accurate
get back down there
you will be killed
i was furious
heads turned in my direction
i recognized many of them
his face was expressionless
as i drew nearer
my feelings were quite mixed
the jewel of judgment
was covered with it
it continued its faint
his breathing was labored
since he was obviously dying
he died fighting for amber
that was something
his eyes tightened
but he said my name
they saved you some trouble
did not they
i did not reply
he already knew the answer
then we will be peers
when it passed
he glared at me
i could feel your curse
all around me
the whole time
as if reading my thoughts
he smiled faintly and said
he gestured with his eyes
he pronounced it then
in a whisper
hold it up
you do not go
eyes rolling wildly
his eyes were still open
i stood then
removed my cloak
and covered him with it
many of them
some strange ones mixed in
the shooting had stopped
i walked forward
i passed among the dead
in the valley below me
the fighting continued
it shimmered before me
i remained still
when he had
he regarded me
i am on the heights
i told him
we have won
his face betrayed no emotion
he nodded and went off
as we waited
please tell me
i smiled faintly
shaking my head
i know all about her
i looked around
his head turned quickly
what is it
benedict was shouting
i do not know
but something is very wrong
is random in the palace
free or confined
i called out
he called back
at that moment
i made contact almost immediately
where are you
in the mountains
i told him
i need your help
bring me across
i do not know
then who is in charge
who do you think
bring me across
i stepped forward
we were two stories up
you are hurt
i shook my head
and everything else
he said softly
i shook my head again
come with me now
it is important
what is the matter
to the pattern
i am not certain
we entered the palace
moving toward the nearest stairwell
do you see all right
we hurried to the right
you are surprised
are not you
so did i
i really did
stranger things have happened
she really cares for me
i am glad for you
spiral stairway down
it was open
i am not
that is over now
did not you
then she joined me here
i will not forget
we rushed on
it was a huge
for whatever reasons
long minutes passed
there is a girl
and the pattern
when last i saw her
she was headed this way
suddenly i am fearful
i agree with you
if she is not
we finally reached the floor
i halted and turned
a very thin blade
good thrust just recently
for that great
i sprang through
random was right behind me
although it is not slippery
the pattern burns upon it
shimmering maze of curved lines
we halted at its edge
something was out there
i felt that old
for a time
crackling with static electricity
then it was not hair
curved horns from some wide
then something else
a faceless woman
a tower of ashes
i cried out
is that you
my voice echoed back
and that was all
it burst through
tall and magnificent now
yet i could not move
then she looked at me
the laughter ceased
her altered voice rang out
i managed a reply
for all practical purposes
then behold your nemesis
who are you
what are you
you will never know
i do not understand
what do you mean
will be destroyed
and she vanished
what the hell
said random then
i shook my head
i do not know
i really do not know
and i feel
he gripped my arm
and it may be possible
pick up the pieces
and i must secure it
we turned up the tunnel
fewer eyes along that route
i would still be spotted
where things are always busy
the guards saw me coming
held a brief discussion
and looked the other way
back less than a week
the court of amber
full of suspicion and unrest
from the very first
as i saw it
i crossed the garden
i swung up the wide
then the third
from the right
studying my face
gesturing with my eyes
regarding my burden
he led the way
opened the door
sought a likely spot
dropped the body
random stared at the bundle
unwrap the goodies
and take a look
he folded it back
dead all right
peel back an eyelid
he began doing these things
remember out loud
they were after you
i wanted it alive
for obvious reasons
he whistled softly
he said very softly
i studied his face
i said flatly
if it were otherwise
under a layer of sod
that looks suspicious right there
to the others
in your head
but they are yours
how did this thing happen
it was right after lunch
back in my rooms
it requested a private meeting
later in the afternoon
i do not know
i took the note back
put it away
but he was not receiving
not a soul
his throat had been cut
i rode the guy down
fought with him
might have been his own
i broke his neck
i withdrew the second note
passed it over
random read it
and handed it back
granting the tight scheduling
here in the palace
i am just back
that is an embarrassing question
i would nominate julian
for years now
hanging around together
but if he liked anybody
i do not know
i just do not know
you are screwed
no matter what you say
i nodded at the corpse
random shook his head
a perfect time
on the other hand
now that he is gone
have you any better suggestions
i shook my head
but self-defense is out
with a cut throat
that covers everything
not even julian
it need not be family
random the reframing is out
he got to his feet
drawing back the drapes
then he remembered out loud
being up in the air
not doing much of anything
dad was still around
a long one
as such things go
lots of good music
gambling around the clock
every couple of days
it was the good life
did you know that
making music and women
palm trees and night-blooming wallflowers
and that was about it
that is how it started
we get the message empty-handed
i just do not know
the jack said
but it was weak
it was brand
he looked like hell
he said again
i am here
ca not bring you through
and i am too weak
look very closely
remember every feature
out a window
over a battlement
i ca not be sure
it was far from amber
with shifting colors
i remembered it
some sort of watch-thing
and there i was
smoking and thinking
and that was that
he was not answering
he was not talking
he was smart
easiest of all
but he had called me
eliminate the positive
he had called me
and if it did not
so it was curiosity
i had say
as you might expect
there was no response
no sense waiting any longer
i cleaned up my blade
ate a big meal
for that matter
i also took a gun
and i was right
like i said
got the sail plane ready
and caught a proper current
the wind shifted
replaced by miles of swamp
i rode the currents inward
gone were the piers
the trees were high
clouds massed in the west
pink and pearl and yellow
you shake your head
in a hurry
go the elemental route
which quickly faded
light and crumbly then
after a time
stark and rolling
erasing it bit by bit
no sun then
but the light remained
it tricked my eyes
it screwed up perspective
i dropped lower
limiting my range of vision
one updraft after another
i rose a considerable distance
when i looked down again
the rocks were racing around
arcing across the open spaces
passing among one another
then i was slammed about
then looked again
i got the nose up
saw where we were headed
and lumps i collected
we both veered
fortunately in different directions
i hurried toward the tower
following a necessarily irregular course
just how long
i was uncertain
larger about smaller
none of them ever still
keeping this in mind
gun in one hand
blade in the other
whatever the reason
the rocks avoided the tower
i checked my weapons
controlled my breathing
and put on the goggles
the shades worked
the beast was waiting
with very faint
like bristles of glass
was like flowing water-living water
a bedless river without banks
what almost froze me
aimed at the nearest eye
and squeezed the trigger
so i threw the gun
leaped to my left
i was hoping
if it was sluggish then
it knocked me sprawling
about fifteen feet above me
maybe a bloody nose
both hands on the hilt
my elbows on my hips
one way or the other
when it finally did
i shuffled my feet
twisted my body
i had done everything perfectly
at that moment
they were armed and ugly-looking
i ca not get through
then i turned
like so many things
i came down alive
i was stunned
i sat up
i got to my knees
i tried my ankle
could not use it
i crawled then
when i saw it approaching
maybe some safety
this in mind
estimated their paths and velocities
readied myself for the moment
when the time came
and looked back
it had been close
for that matter
i commenced massaging my ankle
the brute crossed over
there was constant movement
a changing of textures
slithered by behind it
paced me again
on the wing
worked with the textures
possible to probable to actual
thrashing in the granite traffic
it kept going
buffeted by the winds
the entire pattern was drifting
leaving them worlds away
this was their land
they were wary and unmaimed
i stood for a moment
it was very sore
but it bore my weight
the sky brightened above me
when it went away
i shifted again
shifted its shape
lost its satellites
we picked up speed
but it had not
when i looked again
they were still coming
different guys then
but still chasing me
the sun brightened toward orange
i rested a while
mine was reasonably comfortable
as rocks go
i stretched out
hands behind my head
except for the guards
then everything would be fine
after a time
rolled over onto my stomach
and looked back
they had even gained some
i got angry
to hell with flight
they were asking for it
a little numb
i found them
turning off to the right
the curve tightened
i blocked his arm
and threw him back down
even benedict sometimes retreats
another from my thigh
he went over
so much for him
and then there were four
three more had arisen
at three different points
i kept parrying and moving
i was partly successful
i rushed them
in doing so
like an exotic rug
call back later
and went sliding by
i was thirsty
i awakened to the rain
sudden and hard-driving
it was cooler
the mountains were much nearer
after the eighth try
then i just sat there
smoking and being rained on
not for hours
climbed down when it did
as i went
gradually i restored familiar constellations
my wounds still throbbed dully
i was rested
it was a long hike
up the gradually steepening way
and that made things easier
as i went
i heard an owl nearby
i rode all night
as i descended
and divided by neat highways
punctuated by occasional dwellings
at a great height
moving from horizon to horizon
there were birdsongs about me
and the day was mild
it was julian
where are you
pretty far from amber
i was busy though
and could not talk
that was me
where are you
no one blows where
but how long is long
well over a year
i get the idea
how have you been operating
that is the problem
so we need a regent
it is not that simple
we think dad is dead
what do you think
he may be dead
i have no idea
but it is possible
it does not hold up
somewhere along the line
whatever the reasons
whatever the situation
not just as regent
not just as regent
off somewhere in shadow
i said again
we are forewarned
i was wondering about yourself
what about the girls
we all know it
when is the coronation
good-bye for now
go along with it
stay in his good graces
that was not it
you know what i mean
i decided quickly
he is reasonably open
honest about most things
did not mean he approved
they were gone
as i hurried downhill
growling noise reached my ears
almost in slow motion
a while later
before very long
i located a window seat
smoked for a while
and watched the countryside
after a time
i was ravenous by then
leaving the snack bar
before i picked one up
the oversized jaws
the smoldering eyes
perhaps because of my size
picked him up
if they were not
perhaps others could
my mind ran wild
one by one
i told myself
that is all
get to a phone
get hold of information
and call her
but keep cool now
that point in events
i thought they were yours
you were ready
this explains everything
either you were being cagey
so i flew on out
i was really puzzled
were you genuinely surprised
or was it a put-on
it was simply too late
as for brand
and even if someone did
i had say
chapter 3 i studied random
by looking at his face
in whole or in part
and all those guys
which is no mean trick
it passes through shadow
i laid one on us
curse or no curse
who is she really
what is she
amber will be destroyed
by way of this guy
if that is the case
then returned to his chair
i have heard that
the point is well taken
though almost unnecessary
come up with an idea
prisoner status and all
any of us would
we all have our motives
looking for suspects
aside from motives
apart from opportunities
i would say
then you start
he also has allies
on his own
and was not about to
for one thing
if he were still around
opened the way for them
then he slipped up
you make that sound plausible
and i would have added
except for one thing
before our attack on amber
he had indicated distress
to that extent
refilled our glasses
i lit another cigarette
before we get into that
where is flora
down in town
she was here this morning
i am pretty sure
where should i bring her
if i am not there
from my safe
before he died
that last time
for they were incomplete
apart from shadow
the details were lacking
any extra edge was important
the jewel in my pocket
this was home
this was what i wanted
now i was its defender
it was ironic
things were falling apart
if he had not
then he had acted prematurely
he had not abdicated
a lot had happened since
what our relationship had been
narrow corridor that lay behind
through it then
out onto the platform
across and down
lights every now and then
where had it all begun
perhaps we were all victims
where are you now
i consoled myself
if my feeling represented actuality
around and down
these my thoughts
like thread on a spool
winding or unwinding
the guard rising
putting a light to it
a step at a time
eventually the tunnel
and so up it
counting side passages
echoes and shadows
must and dust
coming to it
not too much farther
finally moved inward
i set down the lantern
just to the right
in the cellar
there i composed my mind
relaxed my body
blue sparks outlined my boots
by the time i did
the strain increased
suddenly the pressure abated
i staggered but kept moving
the city under the sea
the second veil
it was a driving
at the moment
i had always been there
never been away
always would be there
time had vanished
only the tension held
out and onward
three more curves
a straight line
a number of arcs
there it was
right before i rabbit-punched him
my hands were blue flames
my legs pillars of fire
a thawing snowman
a buckling girder
i passed through the veil
a short arc followed
a coffee break for sisyphus
i have done it again
was my second
was my third
thinking over the instructions
such being the case
and i had trusted him
composing my mind
tiny flares and flashes
different curves and paths
i made my decision
i focused my will
redness and slow motion
drifting and darkening
all the pretty lights far
my apparent velocity increased
flakes of light
a trifle faster then
aware of movement
now almost rapidly
the redness was nearly gone
i was speeding
all of this
there was a peculiar
twisted maze was growing
it grew before me
and we were near
this way to that
i was caught
overwhelmed by the blaze
but the buckling
everywhere about me
rather than my galactic analogy
truly and simply
nor was i incorrect
as in the pattern itself
then regarding the pendant
pattern within it
everything within me
me within it
the redness subsiding
then just me
it was a peculiar sensation
i passed outside
onto a very small balcony
the contrast was powerful
dark birds dotted the air
i felt very alone
then to my own
i turned toward flora
it has been a while
and then a while
she looked somewhat frightened
she had cut it
but retained the bangs
she had very lovely hair
excuse me for staring
i made some inquiries
leaned back against the sill
she said finally
this thing is no different
what do you mean
give me what i want
and we will see
all pertinent details
what was the arrangement
what was the understanding
it was in paris
what were you doing there
i had been wandering
looking for something novel
something that suited my fancy
a peculiar coincidence
if you like
my amber surrogate
my home away from home
call it what you will
i was there
at that party
that october night
was her name
that brought it back
from quite a distance
as i said
she went on
i was there
you arrived later
you caught my attention immediately
i grew uncertain
this in mind
checking into your past
the more people i questioned
the more puzzling it became
not an accident
in that place
after a long while
my news naturally disturbed him
what did he give you
i would not be forgotten
a little risky
but not impossible
that was never discussed
she looked at me
then looked away
i do not know
i laughed a little
and she blushed
you stayed on
you watched me
that includes random
she curled her lip
why the sneer
i know you like him
but you wanted the truth
he offended your delicate sensibilities
random joined us rather abruptly
i think so
not that i can remember
i shook my head
this is my inquisition
maybe even a little earlier
what were the circumstances
via my trump
she glanced at me again
i remained expressionless
and that you were hospitalized
in other words
when the attempt failed
her face changed
not an uncommon occurrence
as to the accident itself
i did recall the gunshots
it seemed that i had
even at this late time
i heard the shots
i lost control
she shook her head
then pardon my syntax
either in word or expression
most likely some hired thug
i do not know
took me to a hospital
she shook her head again
when i was with you
i could not raise him
they were all otherwise occupied
is that what you mean
she studied me
just outside the window
i felt a tingle
a mild jolt
the thunderclap was also impressive
you sin by omission
i answered all your questions
what do you want
come with me
where are we going
she rose and followed me
i grunted a noncommittal
family loyalty always touches me
you wear the jewel well
what about the headpiece
i told her
about two miles down
it is a long
vacant most of the time
you were not joking
and parted the ivy
of course not
i still do not understand
kind of spooky
whose idea was it
no one remembers for sure
and red-bearded self
in the meantime
i had to
so i did
he asked me
he is biding his time
did not believe a word
i am sure
but no matter
superior way of regarding things
there are telephones
is it possible
do you think
i do not really know
my original pack
thanks for mentioning it
what do we attack now
and in what order
i have shifted my priorities
if he is still living
i have considered that
beef up their forces
i poured him another drink
they seem simpler now
i offered him a cigarette
how do you know
i have tried it
what did you do
that storm this afternoon
it was mine
why did not you
such being the case
and there are not many
you are getting morbid
you do not need that
i do not know
he finally said
just saying what i see
seeing as we won
but now this waiting
in the city
they are confused
maintain their fighting edge
by the way
i am sorry
i do not need that
knowing my thoughts
headed for the horses
the adjacent highlands stood unmolested
formed a clear pool
brimmed into a tiny creek
what is it
he unfastened his cloak
i folded my cloak
and faced him once again
i said only one word
and you might have forgotten
he came at me slowly
we were both crouched
and he was making slow
was aware of this
was aware of this also
finally i took a chance
ducked and swung
i landed a fast
i heard him grunt
but he blocked my right
he maintained his grip
but i restrained myself
i scrambled clockwise then
i watched his feet
he went over and down
forward and to his left
but missed as he pivoted
catching him on the hip
just above the collarbone
at that moment
but he kept raising me
up over his head
my grip loosened
i saw his fist
the sunrise was lovely
but the angle was wrong
by about ninety degrees
twisting my neck even farther
if he let go
feeling me stir
meeting my eyes
i hear you
i said softly
and benedict is maimed
i am not
it does not matter
just hear me out
during your long absence
hear me out
it does not matter now
that is all
lest you have forgotten
i can kill you
and i will
what do you mean
via my trump
i get the point
they remove me
that leaves julian
whose idea was this
like you always do
he walked off immediately
without a word
it was a whisper
shimmering white encompassed it
cloven hooves were golden
as was the delicate
were a bright
then it made a quick
in the moss
we saw something
i shook my head
in the distance
it was beautiful
those shiny hooves
i had like to myself
all these years
i nodded again
is there a special observance
if there is
save for the water
things had become very still
we were in the library
along with ourselves
he was also ignoring julian
there beside the fireplace
setting aside his tools
quizzical or imperious
she smiled faintly
doubtless aware of my gaze
off in a comer
whether her withdrawal involved animus
self-conscious in her alienation
or simple caution
i could never be certain
probably something of all these
i felt a familiar presence
reaching toward me
i extended my hand
clasped her own
she took a step forward
and moved close
planned and posed
kissing me briefly and withdrawing
i fear i am early
turning toward random
avoiding or at least postponing
her usual clash with flora
i rubbed my aching shoulder
i debated lighting a cigarette
suddenly he was there
and extended his hand
an instant later
crossed the room
she advanced and greeted benedict
nodded to julian
the impromptu conference warmed
all right again
four and three
and two in the middle
we were all present
it was too tempting
nor was i incorrect
realized this fact
made a quick decision
and moved in my direction
but of course
four and four
totally self-conscious and enjoying it
intricately carved frame
nothing had changed
neither cursing nor smiling
i moved forward
but julian too approached
he said pleasantly
she extended her hand
completing the business
for a glass of wine
five and four
who dislikes showing strong feelings
he poured himself a glass
sipped from it
the time has come
let us get comfortable
the others drifted over
more wine was poured
it was a condensed version
and despite their omission
i knew that
they would hear him out
wondering the while
a fruitless yet inevitable exercise
more than suspicion even
julian maintained his slightly bored
slightly amused mask
after some time
while no one betrayed himself
i saw the boredom vanish
the old suspicion abate
interest rose among my kin
then everyone had questions
at first a few
then a barrage
i finally interrupted
let him finish
the whole thing
get the others afterward
there were nods and growls
flora endorsed this part
when the questions came
i watched them carefully
save on later recriminations
so i watched and waited
none of this discussion
would be necessary
that did it
i had them
maybe even willing
benedict asked me
it has been tried
there were nods
an interesting thought
it may generate additional power
i do not really know
let us coordinate things
is everyone ready
eight assents were spoken
then go ahead
i studied my card
he rode a white horse
how long ago
how long ago was that
something of a dreamer
cynical or wholly trusting
he could be so bitter
there followed that familiar blurring
he was manacled
providing sufficient slack for movement
the wretched fare
green they were
with a flat
was he drugged
but suddenly his spirit returned
he raised himself
he extended his hand
i am coming
knocking over his chair
for a moment he froze
studying the card
the image wavered
the contact was broken
i moved for contact
the re-forming occurred
it was a heavy thing
and the ringing
the sliding of bolts
the creaking of hinges
brand raised himself once more
it did not yield
the swordsman fell
its legs pointing outward
they fell back
while this was going on
spilling and dripping the while
clutching at the blade
in the meantime
the chain held
he glanced back
apparently at random
he turned away
stooped and raised brand
who had fallen unconscious again
holding him in his arms
and gestured to us also
and at last
only he looked so weak
for everyone had backed off
and it was dripping
to the rear
then the spell was broken
but what it implied
my quarters are closest
they departed together
both here and abroad
were ineffectual here
on the other hand
he had said
the shape he was in
there was no telling
sutured the wound
and dressed it
he hooked up the iv
and took his pulse again
how is it
i did not have any
i am hungry
passing him the weapon
in the meantime
someone get a fire going
i will do it
a thin stiletto
does anyone recognize this
the girls shook their heads
random studied it
in a boot or bodice
back in the cell
shifting it about his fingertips
i am positive
half a loaf of bread
a bottle of wine
and a goblet
that only leaves us
one of us
what do you think
her brows tightened
when you find him
as i recall
turned to the left
rounded the desk
you leaned pretty far forward
and as i recall
you seem awfully anxious
and began eating
slowly but regularly
the tubes and the bottles
blind once more
in the dungeons beneath amber
for various periods of time
had left its marks
but at night
they come loose
according to his means
must be disturbed also
including the guilty
on the other
julian asked me
not at the moment
if we are lucky
your words are ill-considered
whichever you prefer
turning toward benedict
that is correct
all of us went looking
not at first
it was brand
i told you that
in what way
i do not know
i gathered that much
or in the interim
i do not know
as she spoke
it was in the interim
she went on
how long ago
she furrowed her brow
i am not certain
a day in amber
the nineteenth century
whatever the date
he came and visited me
stayed for several weeks
she glanced at random then
he was asking about martin
did he say why
he asked her
as you say
she smiled prettily
why should i have
random nodded slowly
his face expressionless
what did you tell him
what did he learn
she shook her head
her smile fading
to my knowledge
i do not remember
the others shook their heads
he rose to his feet
stood before me
it is true
i may speak candidly
via my trump
the enemy was dispatched
then they went back
that is all
that is all
but it was not
she had mentioned another visitor
i remembered it quite distinctly
beside the stream
delivering dreams and grinding them
that day we had picnicked
some of them doubtless false
buying his story
because of the other possibilities
having served under napoleon
benedict was both
so i settled for his
that is all
after my accident
drawing things across from them
after a time
in other words
but that is purely conjecture
you know how he was
he gave no reasons
it is a reasonable inference
the others were silent
there was contact
his blade across his knees
he was still eating
what do you want
how is brand
near the end there
he seemed disturbed
preoccupied with something
he shook his head
for whatever it is worth
some time after his disappearance
he gestured with his head
i found a book
told him good night
he lowered his eyes again
for a long while after
wherever he went
lacking evidence to the contrary
i closed off by saying
or anything else
then took a drink
keep up the good work
when he comes around
if he comes around
i think that he will
if brand names him
i was aware of that
smothering a rejoinder from julian
amber will be destroyed
or taught a lesson
perhaps next year this time
there were so many unknowns
i could offer alternatives
such as random then did
but guesses prove nothing
it may be
even if he wants to
so will i
on one condition
so do i
smothering a few misgivings
who agreed also
things came apart
except for the speaker
then she raised her eyes
it involves the pattern
does not it
right before he died
she released it
settled back into her seat
regarded the flames
that limited our conversation considerably
there were three chest wounds
it was difficult
why do you think this
because of this
the longer you wear it
i paid attention after that
the battle raging about him
his face pale
his breath labored
blood on his chest
and the jewel of judgment
there on its chain
the phenomenon had ceased
i asked her
she shook her head
or a higher perception
if you look closely
the greater the power
the larger the investment
walking through shadow
is an even greater expenditure
but the jewel
in the defense of amber
seen in this light
he had said
as i did
as i saw it
a while now
i could not really tell
that was it
that and purely formal distrust
i had wait
she was saying
by the way
she tapped her temple
his mind finally went
i see what you mean
let us think that
julian rose to his feet
nodded to her
and strolled over
not at the moment
any more experiments
waved to benedict and random
he paused on the threshold
turned back and said
and went on out
and biased as it is
in my opinion
is above suspicion
if he wanted the throne
even against dad
he is that good
and we all know it
on the other hand
amnesia and all
at any rate
so he is out
of us more delicate sorts
flora has not the brains
that leaves julian
is he capable
does he want the throne
he is your man
they were buddies
she curled her lip
julian has no friends
but even that
i shook my head
i do not know
i can see it
they were a lot alike
so is mine
on something like this
you say some silly things
as i do
perhaps i have changed
she smiled softly
except for the better
laughing at us all
i am here
and i am not laughing
that is it
springing to her feet
nobility of spirit
i am obviously onto something
the others stared at her
she laughed again
then sat down abruptly
i heard flora mutter
you are insubstantial
patting my knee
and so am i
i feel like hell
not only that
i rose with
walked her to the door
i am all right
she nodded sharply
i hope so
she winked and went out
i turned back
might as well
what was that for
a number of things
poking at the fire
he called after them
learn anything new and useful
no new facts
you or him
that balances the coin again
he said that
the hell with everything
look under it first
we left the room
headed up the hall
along with the guns
i could use a cup
i miss it mornings
but a good idea
she may be right
say it was two
or make something happen
probably the latter
but not tonight
i paused at the landing
we continued on up
he said finally
the room was dark
from the dim hallway
i crossed the room
unfastening my collar
i walked right into it
he had the ideal station
he held the dagger ready
as i doubled and fell
it came clearer
but horse my body stumbled
i was thrown
it was my turn again
i was lying
on my right side
i was wet
and my first thought was
what is he waiting for
i opened my eyes
i turned my head
something was wrong
it was my bed
yet it was not
i squeezed my eyes tight
i gritted my teeth
i did not understand
it was not easy
and i was
i lowered my right hand
the old one
over half a decade before
i pushed myself further
it was bad
the phone would be dead
i enjoy my solitude
i turned it inside out
slipped it beneath my shirt
then i sat there
just holding it in place
after a time
for my garments
i had released it
nothing was supporting it
and it was moving
descending with a dreamlike deliberation
at least for the moment
it probably had
letting me turn
letting me swing my arm
holding on to the footboard
dizziness and too much pain
i made it
a slow crawl
the front door
as i recalled
was now nailed shut
out the back
leaning against its frame
i made my way out
when i regained consciousness
with something near panic
tear my way into it
drop the jewel
the front yard sloped
gently at first
an aspirin for the emotions
with three rest stops
have him transport me back
i turned my head
it was an engine
my mind kept straying
the sound grew louder
i raised the cloth
he went by
a bit older
a woman driving
no visible passengers
it did slow down
but only for a moment
i sagged back and rested
i would use it first
to the compost heap
i shook my head
i was drifting off
more than half a dream
was that another car
if anyone would help me
in a minute
i am a knave
not a fool
when i rest
if only it were warmer
bent over this way
was that a car
then i heard a shout
this was real
i opened my eyes
i forced a grin
how have you been
i am hurt
need a doctor
or should i carry you
we started for his car
realized that it was restrained
having made it this far
and i was warm
i closed my eyes
lowered my head
when i came around again
the simpler the better
i had hitchhiked out
gone on in
his name was bailey
i shook my head
it was dark
did he rob you too
i do not know
were you carrying a wallet
that was all
where is over there
where did you come from
where have you been
i travel a lot
we are a small clinic
it might have been worthwhile
neither of these things happened
even for the emergency room
around seven years ago
you surprised me
and you still do
a tribute to the physician
i had say
may i have your age
for the record
i can take anything
i had guessed that
and you patched me up
what do you mean
we sent an ambulance
in response to what
who reported the accident
i see what you mean
as i recollect
it went to the lake
verified the report
gave you first aid
and called for the ambulance
and that was it
was not there a claim
they could probably
i never pursued the matter
is not it
i guess it was
day and month
it was seven
as he had indicated
i have not
it is probably best
raised his pen
furrowed his brow
i wanted my trumps
joined the family firm
and that was that
particularly the napoleonic wars
the next thing we knew
he arrived within the hour
a bit later
how have you been
the same old stuff
only more of it
wait a minute
i studied it
noted the family resemblances
where have you been
where have not i been
he remained expressionless
caught my eyes and stared
the answer is no
his face relaxed again
can you tell me where
i shook my head
off the record now
i nodded again
i am grateful
curious what you discovered
spreading it across his knees
raising the first of these
he regarded it a moment
raising my hand
you have the order wrong
also the place
first came the accident
the last part
but only very faintly
hear any more bells
you were duly certified
taken into custody
concerning your memory
as i said
that seems right
for a moment
when he had begun talking
but not congruent
about that order
he simply vanished
then you had the accident
were brought here and treated
at that time
contacted this place
her instructions were followed
you escaped again
a couple of weeks later
you have been made whole
the order was vacated
that is a thought
the following month
i ca not promise
by the way
i never thought of that
stuff like that
i will sign anything necessary
i could not do that
do whatever you think best
by the way
before i forget
he reached over
a big brown envelope
kind of bulgy
what could i say
he slipped the case
some kind of tarots
are they antique
cold as ice
a very complicated game
so i did
but so is the redhead
he passed it to me
i could not help it
that just adds atmosphere
what is that
and for that matter
of course not
to your bed
and not the others
he shook his head
i do not think so
i will remember
but i wonder
i can appreciate the feeling
several of them
a matter of interpretation
as i used it
and answer one question
i do not know
what did it say
he was not seen again
i will be damned
i think so
massaging his chin
i hope so
get your rest
i shook his hand
by the way
did not i
what is it
are you human
still gripping my hand
then threw it away
i do not know
but i do not really
of course i am
you really mean it
do not you
i do not think so
neither do i
and he smiled
i will remember that
see you around
probably he had
it always is
a day and a half
i established that i could
it did hurt
less dizzy the second
that was something
dealt private solitaires
i kept telling myself
i had been anticipated
it was random
open the door
are you alone
i am not inside
i do not understand
neither do i
i am hurt
but i will live
tell me about brand
sent him to your room
he came to me
stretching slowly and sitting up
and i will come through
i am missing some clothes
i moved my legs slowly
my practice had paid off
if i moved slowly
get back in that bed
entering the room and advancing
think of it this way
i told her
there will be others
what the hell
he draped a long
take me to him
into the hall
toward the stair
how bad is it
he asked me
that is the best
his stock is definitely bearish
we reached the stair
i do not know
that does look suspicious
but you lived
if it were me
there is that
you might well be right
as you say
like a royal flush
it secures from the inside
i have it
he went below
projected himself into your room
and attacked you
let alone negotiate the pattern
the attacker was already waiting
then he picked your lock
tricks and all
we did that
i composed myself
squared my shoulders
and knocked on the door
just a minute
footsteps approaching the door
who is it
i heard him call back
you want random
and i heard a soft
the door opened
i told him
i entered the library
open your cloak
that is not necessary
because i know who did
do not be an ass
are you certain of that
i have my reasons
and they are valid ones
he stepped to the door
opened it again
and closed it behind him
i moved nearer
how do you feel now
in one sense
most things are
i was not getting technical
what the hell happened
his gaze was most intense
he was studying me
looking for something
i had guess
for this was his way
whatever his reasons
a small concession here
cut it out
he smiled again
you are stalling
be my guest
then he looked away
or are you
did it change you
do you think
i do not know
i guess i did
keep everyone unbalanced with it
it might prove valuable
thus end my preliminaries
all pleasantries are now exchanged
i will bare the basics
bridle the beast unreason
but one thing first
if you would
left there by me
just a minute
your hand is rather shaky
what is the matter
too much partying last night
returning to my chair
would not there
everyone together in one room
unexpected success in finding me
bringing me back
very guilty person
half success there
me injured and mum
but for how long
were you kidding
i was not
in its place
in its place
sequence and order
he sighed and blew smoke
that is good
i can see their faces
i have a vivid imagination
puzzlement-shading over into suspicion
then all of you departed
i am told
stared into the smoke
he chuckled suddenly
as i was musing
all in all
nothing much really accomplished
am i right
you know you are right
then went on
were for it
i sent for you
i am here
i wondered at that
and what you would believe
i snorted again
but this is true
he went on
beginnings are always difficult
wherever i begin
something preceded it
i have said it
and in some ways
prompted by it
but there was no evidence
we worked on this feeling
every now and then
in fairness to you
in the months that followed
who were the others
sequence and order
time and stress
he took another cigarette
using shadows is one thing
whatever the circumstances
i argued against it
two to one
there were three of us
we went ahead then
is he still living
i do not know
things went wrong afterward
he was one of you
as i was saying
should that have proven necessary
i chose the wrong man
in my estimate
unfortunately for us
two to one
so confidently assumed
for the good of amber
what about benedict
and for that reason
but brand raised his hand
twin to my own
broke with them
direct and otherwise
and so i did
then suddenly the pace accelerated
and things really got complicated
as i later learned
for different reasons
they learned what was happening
and got there first
he departed almost immediately
i dragged you out
it was frustrating afterward
still not knowing
not all of it
i only obtained it later
got your location
and kept you heavily sedated
that was too many
since it happened to you
not too fortunate
you had not a chance
as i said
i do not know
i shook my head
i do not know
just tell me
discovered that she was gone
roused all the others
started an investigation
you still may
the hell with her
you have got bigger problems
so i did
the ghostly torchlight
like fires in black-and-white films
i leaned upon the rail
i looked across the world
utter silence held the night
the dream-drenched city
the entire universe from here
the grove of the unicorn
i had say
where the omens
the halls of the lords
the quarters of the low
stick in hand
i passed forward
appeared at windows
unseen i passed
for truly put
silence and silver
and that mostly muted
dimmed by it
silver and silence
its spectacle often disconcerting
i had come
at tracking both of them
it gave me a day
propped in my bed
but probably not
like everyone else
random had said
i remembered saying
and the circle in lorraine
they came a great distance
random had said
stars showing through it
pale halo about its towers
out of the stone
when the moonlight touched them
i had rested all day
illusion of distance and time
i was here
i was there
i lost track of time
off to my right
glittering and curling
i thought of moire
wondered how she fared
i leaned upon the rail
looked across the world
not that it mattered
all the way
through the twisted landscapes
and farther still
and farther yet again
where i stop
i can find
off in shadow
anything i can visualize
any of us can
in good faith
it may be argued
and in fact has
by most of us
that we alone truly exist
and there are several
and things outside of amber
is part of the game
we are impresarios by temperament
most of us are
as i have often observed
why do this
in hope of an insight
i had say
or a new game
as we all have
as we had always thought
now as i stand
without the courts of chaos
had known earlier
they were their own
they had entered our preserve
they were not of it
they threatened it
they threatened us
the danger released was
on some level
almost worth the evidence obtained
we were not alone
whatever our relationship with shadow
where i stop
silence and silver
walking away from the rail
leaning on my stick
shadows of shadows
images of probability
across the promenade now
many of them familiar
what are they about
some lips move
some faces show animation
i pass among them
one such figure
fingers unknotting minutes
casting them away
her form is quite familiar
her head snaps back
her eyes focus
where did you come from
you are early
you wait for me
you told me to
i do not understand
you brought me yourself
are you happy here
you know that i am
it is very important
she turned away
we had that argument
you followed me
and we talked
you were not reconciled
we won the battle
she stood and faced me
is that it
i shook my head
could not exist
the shock was not severe
rising to my knees
recovering my staff
i rose once again
her face grew smooth
i moved aside and turned
silver on silence
not looking back
crossing the promenade
the voice of random
are you all right
anything interesting happening
slow and easy now
into the garden
only the essentials sketched in
only the essentials here
perhaps even a therapeutic device
despite the silver
i had say
the night is very dark
passing along the walks
up an occasional step
across small bridges
moving past ponds
bearing to my right
pressing steadily ahead
after a time
swinging left then
circling around to the rear
a few more figures
a small open area within
if it is not overgrown
long ago there was
none of my affair
away from that hedge
the voice of random
are you all right
consider me reminded
but better than none
toward the palace
for i am driven
among the sparkling grasses
what i must do
up to the rearward portal
across the threshold
the illumination is without direction
wherever it misses
the shadows are absolute
occulting large sections of room
almost running now
monochrome of my home
apprehension overtakes me
fall in and be lost
the throne room
to my right
as i advance
with the drifting
renewing its eyetricking
distracting but bearable
i wait for the blackness
and it slides aside
revealing a hand
the arm a glinting
pinned with flecks of fire
a swiss toy
a mechanical insect
beautiful in its way
and it slides aside
he leans toward the throne
his lips are moving
and it slides aside
turned toward her right
she nods to benedict
her lips move
her lips move again
what are you
that is my question
you answer it
who are you
also of amber
do not move
i have seen his tomb
his body lies within
give me your lineage
but he holds it loosely
benedict winces at this
but she continues
i never knew her
how you came here
i do not know
return to your grave
trouble not the living
my hand wavers
yet that is sufficient
as i fall back
it is uneven
bringing them together
old hand and new
that moment is enough
mechanical hand comes forward
blackness and smoothness
fingers slightly flexed
i do not know
toward his midsection
and there is nothing there
the voice of random
which strangely resembles it
i see it
would have removed my arm
as there is not
i complete the stroke
blackness and smoothness
we both fall
by the unicorn
the sun is rising
i roll to my feet
color returns to the world
wavering stripes of pink
i extend my hand
we untangled ourselves and rose
i sat down again immediately
on the bottommost stair
you all right
i brought food
as random began unpacking provisions
what the hell
i shook my head
i told him
with a hand like that
he worked the fingers
but possibly you are right
i prodded it gently
not especially bad
i am all for you
no matter what
like random did
while you were up there
i said after a while
and then i chuckled
benedict is the eldest
from the beginning
but he was the king
as i understand it
but they died shortly thereafter
he never raised a fuss
it would have
just one more thing
who is next
i shook my head
what became of your mother
she died in childbirth
when he did
i never liked her
and brand was the result
when they were finally divorced
if i were
in that order
let it go at that
as he stands now
but the alternative is julian
random called out
come on and eat
everyone knows that
he could simply say
and that would be it
had he wanted it
taking the worst view
benedict knew better
he just waited
it is possible
i had say
he answered his own question
his body was never found
my guess is this
turn back the invaders
and move on in
and there he would be
he admitted their possibility
i think he was lying
save for myself
to his own succession
just a feeling
what is their strength
an endorsement of higher education
more about the pattern
an interesting thought
if anything happened to dad
and i wondered
an interesting thought
and the food restored me
random gestured with his head
take the same way back
and we mounted
moving single file
random in the lead
the trail ran gently upward
then cut back down again
the air was cool
at that altitude
straying air currents
from the forest far below
as we neared its crest
he controlled it immediately
when he reached its summit
random slowed and called back
i did not halt
you are right
i called out
larger than i recalled
i was certain of it
i called out
has this place changed recently
we drew rein
i do not remember this
even passing through at night
it would have registered
i do not see how
he called back
i believe you are right
we stayed with it
random halted again
this is ridiculous
you are not playing games
down that shaded way
the ground remained level
the trail straight
then random said
this ca not be shadow
have you tried
why do not you
a wispy cloud upon it
another trail upon our way
if it is not shadow
what is it
i did the same
the trail became a path
random ducked a limb
we came up beside him
are now in order
let alone where we are
what do you say
who should i try for
he shuffled through his cards
stared at it
we stared at him
time went its way
he finally announced
i will join you
random shook his head
they do seem different
i shuffled mine slowly
you are right
but let us try again
the results were the same
not the slightest
i suppose they could
but it is highly unlikely
is what it is
according to the manufacturer
and i remember his answer
and he said
achieve a state
smacks of the metaphysical
quite near to amber
i propose we wait
losing ourselves further
i probably did
but supposing it were
looked at me
that may be worth trying
if nothing develops here
we will try it
under these circumstances
they both nodded
one foot in the stirrup
one on the ground
after all these years
i never really believed it
what is it
and he mounted again
amid a clump of ferns
it turned as we moved
and seconds later flashed ahead
i see it
is not it
a good sign
i had say
i did not answer
keeping it in sight
avoiding open areas
favoring glade and shade
an hour had passed
and another had followed it
but only sort of
the ground became rockier
the trees smaller
quite far below us
we are pretty high up
it seemed like lowland
the grove of the unicorn
nor was he incorrect
looked at us
then turned away
as we continued
the trees about us
then and then
my sense of depth
struggling with his mount
like everything else
had been through a lot
and random succeeded
light values shifted next
the sky grew black
not as night
but like a flat
and brightest of all
the unicorn suddenly reared
pawing at the air
then absolute stillness
not even blackness
a gap in existence
then the blackness returned
and the light
only they were reversed
light filled the interstices
then i smelled the sea
i leaned back
it went away
this time farther than before
the light spread
with my knees then
i suggested that star advance
with each pace
sometiling returned to the world
a sense of depth reemerged
unsettling upon reflection
but unnoted while in effect
describing a vast arc
half cupping the smooth shelf
unspecked by sail or island
i saw no birds
random to my right
random finally said
i said again
what does it mean
as i do now
i think so
is not it
there it was
displayed within that light
and i knew
the real amber
how did you know
i asked him
i often wondered
you beat me to it
off to my right
i will lead
seems stable enough now
random called back
i leaned forward
we pass fairly near it
drawing his blade
or been pessimists by nature
because they flattened their ears
widened their nostrils
paused and stared
after a time
he spoke without looking back
i had say so
what is your diagnosis
i can make it myself
ignoring my words
a stray bit of paper
i see it
examining the discoloration
i have noticed it
on the other hand
what do you think
on the other hand
as you say
without waiting for a reply
turned and headed back
he stood before us
he was holding a dagger
i took them from him
looks like a trump
i worked the card loose
smoothed down the torn sections
a trifle sharp-featured
a small smile
somewhat slight of build
i shook my head
i do not know him
let me see
frowned at it
he said after a time
i do not either
at that moment
i agreed with him
took forth his blade
anyone know what it is
he asked quietly
large-footed and wickedly clawed
its narrow head was beaked
purple and leathery
closest thing i know
definitely not our national bird
the beast darted a red
then let them fall
then left and right
flowing effect as it advanced
at that point
and then it shrieked
becoming temporarily airborne
the horses bolted and ran
the thing was tethered
i turned as it passed
on the other hand
the beast touched ground again
showing us its right eye
spreading its wings downward
its tail twitched once
iago had entered the pattern
red at the center
yellow nearer the edges
turning in a clockwise direction
iago continued his struggles
neighing wildly the while
it crouched like a gargoyle
facing away from us
watching the spectacle
and tremendously fast
it touched the rearing horse
and then he was gone
for a brief interval
the funnel remained stationary
like a perfectly balanced top
the trunk raised itself
the wailing ceased
a moment later
do not ask me
i do not know either
fingering his blade
taking a step forward
with that side
do not worry
and i kept moving
off to my left
then it regarded my hand
it wagged its great tail
then repeated the performance
the wagging increased
its head remained motionless
as if enjoying it
i think we are friends
i said softly
now you try it
are you kidding
the beast remained friendly
still stroking its neck
what have we proved
that he is a watchdog
what is he watching
which is understandable
who set him
someone on our side
he finally said
so i will pass
it is not that important
how do you interpret events
that composed of brand
as you said
which provided the dark route
if you are willing
what does it involve
come this way
i followed him
random did the same
what does it involve
the blood of amber
extending the blade
what will happen
random looked at me
what do you say
i am intrigued
he squeezed the finger then
holding it above the pattern
a tiny red bead appeared
i will be damned
there you are
and then he nodded slowly
the blood of amber
are not you
give me the pierced trump
another thing also struck me
it was not his work
if you please
i handed it over
what is it
i do not understand
the blood of amber
he finally said
they stabbed him
obliterating that part of it
as mine did here
it smacks of a ritual
damn all of them
i still do not
i am a fool
i still did not see
now look at me
i realized what he meant
shortly after that
there had been two cabals
to the other group
at about that time
brand had demurred in this
which was almost as good
the trumps-requesting deliverance
was about this business
still relatively unmemoried
engaged in some elaborate bluffing
in the meantime
probably had not
worse off mentally than myself
i won the battle
lost the girl
we quickly learned
black road menaces
the following day
too angry for argument
even wielding his blade left-handed
leaving me his problems
his ill will
at that point
swept on by us
rode into amber
upon completion of the pattern
then she had vanished
about a week later
a lovely blind girl
after i left random
part of this time
at that time
and we succeeded
during this time
rather than his wounds
one of the first signs
and perhaps she was correct
the stroke was almost successful
how i had been returned
i had no idea
clinging precariously to consciousness
bill showed up later
i returned to amber
this commitment made
signifying perhaps nothing
when we reached this conclusion
about that time
pushed its way forward
i did not know
it was the naked
he had seen to that
i do see the resemblance
i said to random
of course i am right
i do not
i do not want guesses
i want answers
on the other hand
i may have something
right after brand was stabbed
nothing new came up
i do not know
over a span of years
some while back
i am not sure
i am now
if he is still alive
if he is not
i was thinking about that
what do you mean
we did this
any time now
a good sign
random did the same
contact came almost at once
what is the occasion
his eyes moving over random
and the horses
then meeting with my own
we all moved toward him
interesting spot you hie from
interesting view from this height
at a few others though
it is still widening
now tell me
you keep heading east
i felt my face flush
there was an accident
we lost a horse
what sort of accident
why the sudden interest
if that is the case
if he is still living
random glanced at me
start with breakfast
while he is doing that
i will find us lunch
his face betrayed nothing
gesturing with his chin
you tell me
it seems to
i think so
at that time
benedict had made no comment
he said now
this is martin
benedict smiled faintly
ambivalent toward amber
see new things
as it were
and i did
someone had to
one day then
have you seen him since
he returned periodically
after a time
several years ago
under the usual circumstances
he showed up one morning
stayed for perhaps two weeks
he set off once more
on the contrary
i broke in
he shook his head
until i saw this one
raising the card
glancing at it
just a few minutes ago
as a matter of fact
of course that proves nothing
i have an idea
it was a body wound
the last that i did
were not you curious
of course i was curious
i still am
no matter how well-intentioned
paused near the ledge
his back to us
fingers knotted behind him
after a moment
he turned and stalked back
he asked benedict
random turned to me
i need a horse
it was not that strenuous
it was mostly fright
and he seems okay now
may i borrow him
before i could answer
he turned toward benedict
you will take me
knowing what we know
benedict looked to me
he can ride star
getting to his feet
i will fetch my mount
an idea just hit me
he chewed his lip
will it help find him
he passed me the card
i will do that
i know that
i rode firedrake
he had insisted
along with recent developments
in the ghost city
raising his new
strange arm in her defense
what do you mean
but not the arm
there was no space
the arm and benedict both
i did not answer him
drawing him to a halt
he stared up then
studying my face
what happened up there
what did you learn
it could well be
as we have sometimes suspected
that arm was solid enough
i told you
we were fighting
were not you
finding a sigh without trying
it is also quite possible
if it is true
just as she said
if it is true
look at random
he had disowned his son
so do i
he would not believe me
he released the reins
i hope you are right
i did not answer
we were not related
that matter concluded
as i saw it
he owed me nothing now
in other words
was that all
the way your crowd heals
do not be too hasty
what do you mean
but maybe not unwarranted
i think you do
it is possible
i shook my head
but are they
if they are that strong
if this were the case
that is a good point
which occurred to me immediately
from the left
i said then
sitting there in my mind
just a moment
she was wearing red
reminding me of darkness past
please come in
i did not want to
but i did
had committed suicide
across the room
i saw her workbench
i studied the bust
curling her legs beneath her
what it is
is that random
maybe a bit longer
massaging it gently
it would be no trouble
just a moment
her sure movements
her confident manner
plying between anywhere and anywhere
dealing in anything
noble or otherwise
after a while
and a flask of wine
a piece of fruit
located an apple
she returned to the divan
have you composed any recently
that part of me is
it is lovely
he is very good
is everything to your liking
he is a good man
i went on
he told me
he forgave you long ago
then it was random
i will be damned
that one bothers random
when i had
that is better
on the other hand
he ate well this morning
which is encouranging
i am sorry
it does not matter
her face still betrayed nothing
but her right hand twitched
she stilled it
i was stalling
taking a sip of
so i did
but she did not interrupt
when i had finished
it seemed possible
i told her
i liked him then
i shook my head
it can embitter a person
i am sorry
and i am sorry
you are fortunate
random has described you
but that is different
she traced my features
has it not
in some form or other
that troubled me every day
what i was
but were you happier
or less happy
than you are now
things balance out
as you suggested
a state of mind
but it is true
the throne remains
if you wished
we can locate such places
these little differences add up
it is an uncomfortable feeling
back on the shadow earth
the place plus everything else
that is amber
that is so
as it is
i closed my eyes
what was it then
least of all duty
he played favorites and
facts are another matter
you are right
opening my eyes
give me your hand
it was a good lunch
her hand still partly raised
good luck to you
the moment my footsteps ceased
and went out quickly
for one thing
in my bedchamber
and got into bed
when finally i slept
scraping away at the door
i sat up
i reached for my clothes
as a matter of fact
i am all dog
the stairs and down
no sounds from below
maybe even a trifle wiser
more hunter than victim
tempered the hate
i do not truly know
stillness on the second floor
a few noises from below
and down again
unless there was trouble
the ground floor
replied the senior
and i continued on
it would work
i was sure of that
i entered the long corridor
stepped out onto the platform
then down once more
that spiraling way
a light here
a light there
random had been right
i decided then
said the lean
smoking his pipe
grinning around it
nothing much else astir
you enjoy this duty
i will be happy
before too long
i neared the wall
sighted the proper corridor
my feet knew the way
it gave way grudgingly
moaning as it moved
then i raised the lantern
held it high
the magic was still there
a desk in the foreground
a globe beside the desk
the line grew clearer
i wiped it again
exerting a little more pressure
i unfolded the blanket
shook it out
tore off a fresh strip
making up a new pad
and a tall candlestick
i drew back
right and left
across from one another
the other partly ajar
there was a long
instruments of unknown function
at that moment
then i turned
about five feet in height
he carried an oil lamp
is it finally time
what time is that
i asked softly
kept my voice low
you remain unconvinced
peering down at me
why must you spoil things
i have spoiled nothing
he lowered the lamp
i turned my head again
i shrugged and stood
yes and no
something of value might emerge
he threw his head back
his arms lengthened
his bulging abdomen narrowed
his hump was totally resorbed
his features steadied
closed with a smirk
not half bad
i will help you
any stall served me somewhat
buying reactions for my study
but staring into the shadows
i drew out the fire-building
you tell me
he chuckled again
you changed your mind
that is what happened
do not mock me
least of all
i got to my feet
i was not mocking you
i seated myself
how did you recognize me
that is true
how have you been feeling
there is a fading
there is an intensifying
the shock of your visit
you know that
you know that
i suppose that i do
all over again
tell me a story
anything you like
have you any preferences
my meditations upon the abyss
beyond their aid
i planned and built
captive of my new self
tell me of its cure
i am the pattern
in a very real sense
the foundation of amber
a beautiful closed system
he fell silent
i listened to the fire
i was wrong
such a simple matter
with which i drew it
could deface it
you could use it
collect one generation of ancestry
proceed to confusion
a king of chaos
by the unicorn
what then is your desire
he shook his
i am stubborn
so tell me again
bright and pure
for broken as i am
what say you now
leaping to his feet
would not it
nothing has changed
you still do not understand
my feelings are foreordained
end our troubles
heal your spirit
where is your memory
i would like that
you really mean it
he said after a moment
let us go
i followed him
somehow familiar odor
the odor grew stronger
after a brief time
i heard him say
i am not going far
it is all right
i do not know
but the purple griffin
did i ever say that
you did not have to
i am not a fool
have it your way
staff raised before him
it was night outside
continuing after him
forming a fantastic
oblique latticework which
more than anything else
there you are
the hole in my mind
only around it
i do not know
you see no other way
i see no other way
i see no better way
i must know more
it was done
let it go at that
yet it failed
they strike out against everything
i do not know
then he shrugged
i have no idea
it was gotten
it is not your work
of course not
but this answers your question
does it not
if there is another generation
your children will destroy it
as we would destroy them
my best pupil
your son brand
that is his style
random lacks courage and determination
he went on
are you testing me again
then he might have changed
i do not know
i believe he is changed
he stared at me again
and he kept staring
he said at length
i did not
his eyes widened
it has been so long
what of my question
he advanced slowly
and reaching up
but i felt no heat
he looked into my eyes
you have changed
after a time
he looked away
will you help me
i do not know
that i will be able
this thing with my moods
when i turned
the griffin was there
his tongue darting
we are returning now
it is all right
a clink for every pace
the jewel of judgment
and we resumed walking
how did you obtain it
on his deathbed
we entered the cave
you have it now
why is that
in what fashion
we rounded a corner
what does it mean
what is that
how is this achieved
you must surrender to it
blot out your identity
but it can be done
i shook my head
we moved on
my thoughts grow meaningless
or the next
or the next
why the rush
i do not know how
take the light
get out of here
seizing the light
i fled the room
a sudden chill upon me
to the desk
i heard footsteps then
i did not look back
it was an unfamiliar scene
a mountain crag
something indistinct beyond it
a strangely stippled sky
somehow rearranging the prospect
from right behind me then
gnarled-reached over my shoulder
but the vision seemed ready
from snatches of legend
bits of family gossip
chapter 6 where
though my footing was undisturbed
at the moment
when i say danced
i do not mean twinkled
they darted and they circled
they flared to nova brilliance
belts of orange
and purple turned and twisted
patches of green
shimmered and wavered
the end of the universe
the end of everything
were absent here
a single edifice
or simply a place
it was pleasant standing there
before the pattern
this thing was
i knew this
dimly but purely
i knew this
i am certain
a similar lack of comprehension
a similar sense of apprehension
a sense of the forbidden
a feeling of dubious anticipation
at that moment
across the chasm
for now i discerned tiny
regarding them carefully
there was a movement
in only a few moments
as it came on
a moment later
both deathly pale
rushing in my direction
so unnatural was his mien
they came on
they regarded me then
the rider demanded
give me your name
who comes to this place
loud and without inflection
i shook my head
who are you
he gave three short barks
talk is cheap
whisky costs money
thinking of me
but it was dim
the distance is too great
as i had hoped
while this was occurring
as the rider advanced
meeting my own
his nasty grin vanished
i know you
but we had him
me and my ally momentum
i was already lunging
now fully footed
plunged on toward me
i cut again
at that moment
the beast bellowed
and rushed away
i was backed against rock
from the ledge
i turned sideways
hilt level with my head
point toward the ground
the only shield i possessed
he raised the crossbow slowly
our eyes met
he was beardless
he managed his mount well
his hands were big
he called out
he continued his appraisal
what do you want here
then he galloped away
without affording a suitable ascent
an ascent seemed possible
no new riders advanced
i commenced climbing
the going was not difficult
after a time
i beheld the chaotic colors
from my right
the darkness herded them
passing through its midst
inky and serpentine
as i had once believed
in other words
me as the agent
in some larger sense
had something occurred recently
or something else
certainly not this far
had any of the others
within recent memory
at that moment
and twisting perspectives
i felt his mind
breaking the contact
there was contact
where are you
he extended his hand
no one else was present
i think brand did
glad i hurried
he kept asking for you
he could not
i was distracted
he is right
where is he now
back in his own quarters
a few brief walks
any word on random
benedict returned several days ago
one led further
it sounds strangely familiar
i will bet
where is he now
he shook his head
turning toward the door
i will remember that
i told him
brand stood beside this one
staring out toward the sea
he was still pale
you are looking better
how are you feeling
he turned and regarded me
his eyes half-closed
hither and yon
and i heard you
reopening the door behind me
wait a minute
i am sorry
i do not know
i waited longer
first i was impatient
when i inquired again later
you then departed once more
when he failed
i was quite concerned
i tried it myself then
i feared for you
i was abrupt
he smiled faintly and nodded
that is something
for my pains
you wanted me for something
something is bothering you
you have a distinctive style
in all things
you stole my next sentence
gave me one brief
sidelong look and then nodded
did not it
where did you find it
right where you left it
i shook my head
you answer my question first
did you stab martin
stared a moment
then nodded sharply
someone had to
we drew straws
and you won
did you kill him
i do not know
if he did not
you need look no further
now that you have
i shook my head
for all i know
who was with you
it is still your turn
why have they not moved
what are they waiting for
i do not think so
you have dealt with them
do not weasel
you have been busy
you are not
but i am a fool
a sentimental one
here in amber
so long ago
i reached beneath my bed
what was that
i saw nothing special
just as he said
on the floor
with a small geometric pattern
my anger passed
i was not stalling
she is extremely dangerous
i have a plan
to a different end
directed by yourself
wherever they may be
we hold them
locked in the full
in the flesh
as you did martin
with all of you helping
time is running
so will i
what do you say
it is necessary
in her case
what do you mean
forget about being convinced then
just tell them
do not you
by doing things my way
sooner than you think
you know what i meant
when you get it
it may be too late
we will see
i reached toward the door
i shook my head
i can appreciate that
then he smiled
i opened the door
it was random
if you mean
the answer is no
i headed for the stables
as i rode and digested
from an immediate
i drew rein
i am here
as for using them
think about it
or did something come up
where are you
as chance would have it
you are all right
come ahead then
the way you people do
it is not that urgent
for a moment
perhaps rightly so
the descent went quickly
by the way
what news have you
nothing like that
including the guesswork
how did he take this
he seemed excited about it
i had even say
come talk with him yourself
perfectly executed gesture
i owe you an apology
i have wronged you
i am very sorry
whatever the circumstances
is that not so
to that ease
may it always prevail
where were you headed
he had passed that way
i was there
as i said
random had impressed me
if this were so
you were not available
who inclined his head slightly
a mendacious one
what is your next move
the notion somehow pleases me
he put down his glass
he made a fist
rotated the wrist
extended the arm
do not you think
i did this
wearing that arm
when things cleared further
when i demanded her lineage
she again bade me depart
during this time
and we fought
that was all
how did you read it
you have never seen her
but i have
as for the rest
he nodded slowly
i asked him
i shall seek her
and then decide for myself
when i was young
to the end of everything
beneath a divided sky
if such is the case
such is the case
how can you be certain
the road goes to it
how difficult was the way
i only just tried it
it took me there
trump contact is difficult there
he studied the card
he said at length
this solves our logistics problems
there may be another way
he pursed his lips
it is not relevant here
i understand that
i see the analogy
the possible connection
and your pursuit
he only smiled faintly
do you recall it
he narrowed his eyes
i had forgotten
how much larger
not too much
perhaps a few weeks
say you succeed
someone gave them passage once
they require a lesson
that is what i meant
it is necessary
he smiled and stood
if you do not mind
i do not mind
we finished our wine
very soon now
he smiled again
things are better
we followed him outside
he offered benedict his hand
for many things
benedict withdrew his trumps
before my horse arrives
he riffled through them
is this dangerous
where is the jewel
back on the shadow earth
where i left it
why did you abandon it
there must be another way
i had take it
he turned away
you know your own realm
it is my duty
i told him
he did not reply
a dozen paces away
for he would mutter something
then pause and listen
we stood there
he is here now
i heard him say
i doubt that very much
i do not think so
he extended his new hand
as if searching for something
what is the matter
most of him is not
he left some blood behind
as you can see
what makes you think i
you know his temper
we had a small argument
maybe cut himself
fancy rug before his door
i do not think so
he avoided messing it
i do not buy it
he turned toward benedict
regarding us without expression
so much so
that is our business
use your brains
i told him
you wanted something from him
you finally got it
then he became an impediment
if he has been killed
he came at me again
i kept jabbing after that
i kept circling him
but he was open
that was it
turning my head
was now grasping it
was holding it back
i rolled away
when i looked up again
stay out of this
get the jewel
even as he called out
supporting myself with one hand
for several moments
dusted myself off
do not stay around
go find the trinket
when i emerged
but benedict stood before me
nothing final without a conference
but not me
i headed toward the horses
i had go with you
do not worry
i was mounted and moving
several rises and dips later
in good shape
in the meantime
with one exception
the old trail twisted
into the thickening wood
after perhaps an hour
an always moist
logs and mossy rocks
bird notes sounded about me
never too near
had been for some time
the trail rose again
pass among rocks
and head downward once more
circling and circling
high above me
we plunged downward
to the dimness
easier farther along
patrolled by his rangers
here he was strong
backed by his own men
too far away
he had his hellhounds
he had his birds
a half mile
we took advantage of this
then from behind
but it was no dog
i glanced back
after a time
i looked again
it was time
perhaps two hundred meters across
much nearer now
passing a lone
lightning-blasted tree as we did
shrieking a savage battle cry
more a vibration
a shuddering of the ground
i looked back again
the clearing widened
it became completely level
i turned for another look
it bounded into view then
that the riders
i leaned forward
it was a panic reaction
on the other hand
i felt myself sliding backward
but i had
for the moment
a dozen or more dogs
leaping and biting
sending one flying
stunning or killing two others
it reared then and turned
in the meantime
two more plied its haunches
in the meantime
snapping and tearing
there were five of them
julian in the lead
the beast turned toward him
and leaped ahead
they came together
they remained mounted
he regarded the still-twitching manticora
looked back at me
and headed in my direction
he glanced at the sky
i followed his gaze
i am sorry
did brand make it
she departed during the night
and for that matter
if intent counts for anything
i was crowded aside
for a long while
we had a long talk
the events are in order
but the reason is not
at least not that abruptly
nor at that time
then you turned up
with your very legitimate claim
that was how it happened
you are a fool
he finally said
and either way you lost
if it failed
as it did
as he did
i bit my lip
he did have a point
then he spoke very softly
almost a whisper
hear me out
it was mine
as we saw it
there was no choice
you saw too soon
how did you manage it
he regarded me once more
i lack the particulars
for some reason
after all this time
he was weak
but it is considerable
and simply steps through
for that matter
near the end
after his recapture
who was then his bodyguard
before we could
in such a case
between the two of them
he reached me once
obviously not totally
that i do not understand
in that attack he launched
back on the shadow earth
she is certainly the loveliest
most civilized of us all
as well you know
she accepted their defeat gracefully
and that was that
brand told things differently
for one thing
i suppose this is possible
are we not
over the black road
but mark me
he has a plan
he is always scheming
perhaps you are right
whether for good or ill
this is not the case
and brand is missing
neither do i
it was too late
state of affairs
how can this be done
what is that
brand wants the jewel
he was asking about it
how good is it
julian looked thoughtful
he is hardly omniscient
it is therefore an object
he is a good beast
a sturdy fellow
but i will try
get you gone
i glanced at the manticora
they were blue
if it was
a turn to the left
the ground is brown
the trees squat down
a rumble shakes loose raindrops
steep and rocky now
die down in the rain
to the craggy
horns guarding the trail
lightnings twist about their tips
dance between them
the rain suddenly blocked
the wind shunted away
emerging on the farther side
there is no rain
the air is still
meteors cut and burn
cut and burn
cauterizing to afterimage scars
three bright dimes
a dull quarter
a pair of pennies
ragged and swift
the trail buckles
soon it drifts
stars below on either side
there is no land
there is only the night
night and the thin
against some future use
it is absolutely silent now
the trail falls away
the stars bright fish
it is freedom
from nowhere to nowhere perhaps
we race a great meteor
we touch upon its bulk
speeding across its pitted surface
then up again
it is sand
sand now beneath our movement
swaths of shade ahead
desert trees within them
ride for the dark
bright birds burst forth
among the thickening trees
darker the ground
narrower the way
a twist to the right
a widening of the way
the lane enlarges
becomes a tree-lined street
tiny row houses flash by
set back beyond flagged walks
a horse-drawn cart
loaded with fresh vegetables
a small buzz of voices
passing beneath a bridge
blue clouds scudding
the smooth anatomy of driftwood
losing its identity
up to the flattopped
a golden city shimmering
at its end
the city grows
darkens beneath a shadowy umbrella
its gray towers stretch upward
as we pass
a gentle noise
as of a snuffed candle
a dust storm
the sounds of automobile horns
a brief lift
a break in the gray-white
to the right
endless rows of unmoving vehicles
directionless shrieks and wailings
random flashes of light
rising once more
the fogs lower and ebb
clear now the sky
and delicate blue
a cow in the field
staring and chewing
tin-roofed farmhouse atop a rise
curl of smoke above it
the hills grow up
the sun rolls down
darkness dragged behind
a sprinkle of stars
here a house
set far back
i wiped my brow
but i kept going
i heard him drive off
passing familiar landmarks
recalling other times
wider and better
i turned there
there was very little wind
an occasional stirring of branches
after a time
rubbed his neck
i returned to the road
no cars in sight
passing behind the station wagon
off to the right
something was wrong
the back yard was changed
for that matter
was the chicken coop
were also gone
i looked again
studying the house now
approaching the first lighted window
i glanced in quickly
it needed some new windowpanes
some roofing work
outside as well as inside
on mv hands and knees
blood leaking from my side
the memory was slightly blurred
i crossed the road
i told him
not too far this time
continuing on past my house
no sense wasting it
a half hour
and i was into town
houses all about me
i turned up his driveway
stared a moment
expediency is all
that nurse at the clinic
scarcely anyone believed her story
what was her story
and just faded away
you know that
complete with sword
i shook my head
when this is over
time is doing terrible things
my old house
you know him
yes he did
bought some heavy equipment
i handled his incorporation
it is gone now
he finally said
sure as death
just what is it
a ruby pendant
you are right
if it were anyone else
forty or fifty carats
pretty good reason
tell me about him
he cradled the phone
had a beard
said he was an artist
son of a bitch
and returned to the kitchen
he said after a moment
the yard was already clear
and i began eating
he made the call
i had better get moving
i will drive you out
he must have tools
bill shrugged and smiled
let me use your bathroom
he is my brother
no fault of mine
he was there
said he was an artist
and ed let him
get the stuff
i will meet you there
i drew forth his card
performed the proper mental maneuvers
i had contact
brand is alive
if that is any consolation
this is important
life and death
i do not understand
what is happening
no time now
here is the next thing
how serious is this
when i drew up
he was talking with ed
as i dismounted
ed was studying drum
you have been away
we shook hands
i will get my shotgun
if you like
and go with you
how about your horse
clean him up a bit
i know i would
as we crossed the field
searching for the heap
i drew a deep breath
what do you think
i do not know
i told him
give me some light here
running the tines through it
after a time
so do i
we kept pulverizing and spreading
pulverizing and spreading
i straightened and waited
contact came moments later
what had you say
leaning upon his great blade
you were right
brand did show up here
just a moment ago
he just disappeared
i could not tell
in this bad light
stay on guard
the sense of contact
remained with me
what is happening
i do not know
wait a minute
there was contact again
it is important
brand has it
neither do i any more
but was scared off
she nodded her small
she looked tired
i am aware of this
i have him under surveillance
according to my calculations
the first time through
that saves time
we must stop him
come to me
i will take you there
just a minute
i want drum with me
then bring me through
i extended my hand
in a moment
i held hers
she stepped forward
is not she
this is bill roth
a very good friend
a few minutes later
i led him forth
my brother has the thing
thanks for helping me
i shook his hand
that is my name
we have been talking
your sister and i
so good luck
across the field
that is correct
that is basically correct
i can see his point
in the courts of chaos
you use the past tense
he would not
because of this
i give up
he possesses unbelievable resources
it were better he died
this being the case
i was not co-operating
but that brand did not
do you believe me
into a misty
then up again
this impression was reinforced
i suddenly realized
let me rephrase it
just answer one question
who shot out my tires
she laughed again
you have figured it out
have not you
you tell me
who called the police
he hoped that they could
what do you mean
you did it yourself
what does it fit
and neither did the est
this was just partly successful
the accident may have contributed
where i walked the pattern
if this had not occurred
you guessed correctly
brand was afraid of you
i do not know
probably the latter
however he located you
you now know the rest
or so he said
not that it matters
you are wearing your blade
brand told me
not all that long ago
is this true
then why am i here
is not as great
the light ahead grew larger
but there were no drafts
or smells from that direction
for what had happened since
for what was happening now
and what did i want
that would be enough
there is no more time
and she was right
the light had grown large
become a circular opening
the golden sun which floated
there was nothing but rock
small and distraught
she shook her head
she said softly
i did a quick calculation
so it would be close
the sparks grew quickly
i looked up
then he saw me
a point in my favor
if you do
you are too late
he called out
i did not answer him
i just kept going
i kept going
it would be no contest
on an impulse
i continued forward
i kept my eyes low
the fires partly diminished
as for me
i could feel its stirring
all of my strength
my own identity
i pushed through
the monochrome fog
i sought brand
struggling with the grand curve
if i pushed hard
at that moment
brand struggled and advanced
i struggled too
but not as hard
i kept the pace
i wondered as i went
about the jewel
i could feel its presence
feeling its presence
within my mind
feeling it now
i considered its other functions
laying my will upon it
nothing happened immediately
brand came to the end
offered a final exertion
he knew it
turned his body
we were hampered
he withdrew his right then
just a few more paces
followed by a great roaring
brand glanced up
is not it
and then he attacked
even as i parried
i raised my right arm
as i did
yellow about the edges
pointed in my direction
with my mind
with his left hand
sucking his fingers
he looked upward
the cone fell toward him
his outline wavered
with him went the jewel
i decided on the latter
so i rose slowly
to what place
had brand taken himself
if i knew
once i reached the center
i consoled myself
this is my son martin
clasped my hand
he scrutinized me
so was i
then let me welcome you
rather than there
i glanced at random
and under very nasty circumstances
do you blame him
ran into him
you have lost me
he is our man
and he is very dangerous
what happens then
random said again
could this be done
looking back over the years
recalling his personality changes
his cycles of moods
it does not really matter
he would change
after a while
i looked at him
for a moment
all of our egoism
he must be killed
i am sorry
you are young
i have seen more things
tell me about yourself
ever since he attacked me
after i mentioned them though
i know something about it
it is difficult
walked the pattern
coached you in weaponry
stared off into the west
brand contacted me then
this felt the same way
and for a moment
i was curious
so far as i knew
he held the contact somehow
benedict had taught me that
he tried again
but i kept blocking
but after a time
i asked him
tell him of your fears
i thought of that
that i was indeed dead
i did not understand it
my curiosity was aroused
it was dangerous
so i was careful
or trouble nearby
he went on
of riding too far
a young girl
we talked interminably
it was very pleasant
in the courts of chaos
even sketched it for her
she told me that amber
in the meantime
i could only listen
but when i mentioned him
she said no
what do you mean
almost a week
and she did
she remained several days longer
but she said no
but i was still afraid
and so i traveled on
she succeeded in that
she was kind to me
she is a likable girl
as far as i can
as time and opportunity permit
there have been new developments
i thought about martin
i felt that it was
on the other hand
maybe something harmless
quite the contrary
it was nothing like that
fear and self preservation
on a sudden inspiration
i asked him
just that time
you have the jewel
brand has the jewel
which one is it
brand has the jewel
tell me about it
so i did
not in such detail
he glanced upward
you have a better idea
that takes time
for all you know
i do not know
whatever the case
he will probably be tired
that should slow him some
put yourself in his place
if you were brand
instead of an afternoon
you are right
but i do not know
you do not know
that is a peculiar place
it is a risk
i do not know
but possibly more realistic
that is correct
right next to the pattern
i see the point
but not the answer
hold on a minute
you imported a master strategist
i am listening
but someone else can
who and how
he has returned
at this moment
he is in amber
i see the advantages
slapped his neck and smiled
pesky little things
you still think
that is what i think
but not the game
you surprised me
moving so fast
so i did
thanks for the good counsel
that one sounded important
as a matter of fact
i need star
is that all
haste is all
we moved toward the horses
the sky overhead was clear
and filled with familiar stars
i was weary
even against stone
was a luxury
a pure animal pleasure
a hot bath
a full meal
not all of them
and i felt
rotate them properly
the pace of recent events
i regarded the horizon
as i watched
i glanced up then
i withdrew my trumps
as the light grew
the first lines
faint as spider webbing
appeared above the rock
i reached for contact
his cold image came alive
standing at the designs center
is it time
i told him
the moon is rising
i am ready
i encountered the fourth stair
i said to benedict
i mounted the stone stairs
so i waited
watching the moon
as this occurred
if i had the mind
and pallid beauty
the stair is solid
the moon is up
i am going
and so was pattern
this time outside the pattern
he was alone
walked to the wall
set the lantern beside it
its configuration was the same
i retreated down the stairs
i never trusted brand
he told me
what did you learn
halted when he had finished
it does not matter
we had gained a day
we would then pursue him
the man was mad
leave it at that
heredity or environment
i wondered wryly
we were all of us
to some degree
mad after his fashion
that is all
in this sense
mad or not
he had gone too far
random had changed
quite a bit
in recent years
like most such questions
not the answering
it did matter
whatever the reason
the moon was higher now
i thought of advising benedict
and suddenly brand was there
my hand fell again
do not try it
when the echoes died
i am not a fool
brand began walking
that is right
brand began moving again
i am talking of reality
not daydreams made solid
not second best
i did not do it
began walking again
the jewel burned more brightly
his voice rang
you are a fool
what of knowledge
there would be a price
returned to normal focus
you mean it
you really mean it
he halted again
you can be with me
you will command our legions
on the other hand
thank you for your offer
you are a fool
a well-meaning one
but a fool nevertheless
he kept moving
and simply stared
benedict met his gaze
i checked the clouds again
brand finally said
unarmed as i am
it should not be difficult
what are you waiting for
yet you stand ready to
benedict simply nodded
admit that you fear me
you must be afraid
benedict did not reply
brand went on
you fear my death curse
that bastard puppy
he was only a tool
would it ransom my life
he halted once more
ten feet from benedict now
enough of th
he stood stiffly now
tried the jewel
moved a little nearer
kept up this movement
and i exerted my will
his trump was still functioning
i felt his presence
they were still growing
the city disrupted
and set it aside
because you are the best
bring me through
but it was no use
there was no response
it seemed slow
indicating that somewhere
inside it all
benedict was still conscious
brand toyed with the dagger
he was saying
on the other hand
in a way
for a moment
the pattern faded behind them
his back to the pattern
he took another step forward
but enough of this
at that instant
thing of glinting
pinned with flecks of fire
a swiss toy
a mechanical insect
beautiful in its way
the arm moved upward
the pattern faded once again
benedict remained frozen
holding him on high
a human gallows
the pattern grew dimmer
the moon was halfoccluded
he was strong
as all of us are
he bit his lip
he rolled over once
benedict lowered his strange arm
he flexed his other arm
he sighed deeply
the pattern grew even dimmer
the moon was almost gone
can you hear me
the city is fading
i extended my hand
but brand was sinking also
for a long while
we did not say anything
that shortly i must sleep
i could scarcely think straight
regarding cloud and star
if only the proper jiggle
or flip were applied
they were jiggling
and flipping now
almost of their own accord
is he dead
do you think
right now it
does not really matter
you have drawn his fangs
he finally said
the pattern is safe now
i wish that some time
had we known
i did not answer him
it did not matter
whatever that means
and then again maybe not
there is always a reason
outrageous situation on your hands
if you care
brand had acted
so as for the rest
leave it to heaven
i am not qualified
i have been thinking
when i did not elaborate
he finally said
i asked him
under unusual circumstances
it proved itself tonight
against the jewel
how was it done
i have no idea
you asked the wrong question
what should i have asked
that is ridiculous
he must be dead
benedict rose to his feet
he shook his head
without testing my guess
that is hardly sporting
i do not think so
he sat down beside me
we stared at it
i relaxed my mind
i reached for contact
it came almost immediately
a black road
the door to that library
closed and barred
i even brought lunch
just a minute
rounded the desk
crossed the room
he carried a tray
plenty of food there
i am hungry
so do something about it
he poured wine
we seated ourselves and ate
after a time
are not you
i do not know
it was sort of abrupt
was not it
i am not so sure
he must have his reasons
did not it
that is ridiculous
what are you getting at
i will admit that
he shook his head
are not you
i looked away
there is that
i finally said
or not just for it
it is him
neither can you
the attack order bothers you
does not it
among other things
if we could wait longer
but we may not be
these separate orders
so did i
maybe i would not either
i shook my head
poured more wine
what about you
he shook his head
i will know
at least with julian
when did he say this
after you left
and they rode off together
i saw them off
what else did i miss
he shifted in his seat
the part that bothers me
that is all
that is all
then why the laugh
i give up
it might not be suspicion
come with me now
i got to my feet
where is martin
he is in good hands
i do not know
we left the room
we headed for the stairway
on the way down
i pushed my way through
what is happening
damned if i know
look for yourself
and that was it
totally invisible wall
clasped my hands
no mean trick
a girl was nearby
on the dais
beside the throne
after a time
the exchange continued
that girl looks somewhat familiar
i told him
his voice faded
i was not lying
she is real
there was no response
random strained forward
so i tried again
i eased back
we ca not move it
what is the damned thing
i could not
the heavy shadows
it was very similar
but not precisely so
his body angled differently
i doubted it
does not it
but as you can see
i am wearing my blade
so like my own
in a moment
give him hell
it is no use
how can you know
that is me in there
fighting with him
i do not follow you
i shook my head
i told him
what two things
and moving past the other
the mechanical hand
as was the blade
when both reached the floor
vanishing from sight
i lurched forward
recovered my balance
the barrier was gone
random and i got there
since i live here now
bring her through
you mean on a trump
yours or hers
give me those cards
martin went on
what the hell
there is one of you
one of her
where did you get these
let me see them
was it brand
i extended the card
who is this
you are lying
and i turned to her
she still knelt beside benedict
how about it
waving the card at her
who is this man
she glanced at the card
then up at me
you really do not know
his name is merlin
i am not easily shocked
i felt dizzy
but my mind moved quickly
that amber must be destroyed
the one next to it
it is all right
getting to his feet
she can explain everything
then let her start now
such is the stuff
it was empty
we had talked
of the family
i come from the enemy
a high lord of chaos
and your appearance
have you ever tried
perhaps you can
on the other hand
i do not know
as to myself
and a son
including the murder of martin
answer it yourself
what about brand
he had ambitions
he needed knowledge
he offered a deal
what sort of knowledge
for one thing
looked at me
but he was not trusted
or one destroyed
and finally replaced
when the time came
that balance i spoke of
amber would become an island
from which all things arose
the two of you
we are not alone
where did you get that
she gave it to him
he scrutinized it
it is his
why do you have it
she told us
she shook her head
not too damned well
and you want one here
she smiled again
i withdrew a trump
glanced at it
what of merlin
where is he now
they have him
he knows his parentage
i raised the trump
stared at it
i tried anyway
i tried harder
do you hear me
and then there was nothing
the card lost its coldness
did you reach him
i am not sure
but i think so
just for a moment
better than i thought
where is he
he contacted me
he rose to his feet
he shook his head
it makes no sense
on the other hand
i hear things
i do not know
to what end
i do not know
possibly only moments ago
last i heard
i told him
i see what you mean
so give me a hand
came to my side
this is not really necessary
we had contact
is dad there
i know who she is
i had some suspicions then
and this confirms them
what do you mean
if he makes the attempt
whether he succeeds or fails
that dad would
i would guess
once he has confirmed it
i will try
she broke the contact
i asked her
something involving the black road
he had indicated that much
he did not say
i turned away
i shook my head
supposing dad tried it
where would we be then
right where we were now
only without a leader
what are we waiting for
i stood and thought
i pushed it away immediately
but it returned
i did not like it
it is true
bring me through
you heard me
i extended my right hand
benedict was on his feet
and i stepped forward
saw that it stood open
his eyes narrowed
i knew that look
what is this
you are here without leave
it will be
i moved nearer
i never had before
for the barest moment
at any rate
i went on
so i ran on
i heard the expected bellow
i followed the twistings
i stumbled only once
i raced toward it
i sprinted toward the pattern
feeling through the jewel
better me than dad
at that moment
even if it were available
i renounced both
what was left
but she had been right
but not duty alone
there was more
pushed that thought away
pushed that away
slowed my breathing
no more preliminaries
i told myself
my mind drifted
i heard a sound
it would be dad
in a moment
they had emerged
why had they stopped
what did it matter
i could barely move
near to the end
it was almost as if
before i looked down
at this distance
once i made it
it happened again
when i opened my eyes
when i turned my head
i saw feet
when i looked up
i almost made it
he took my arm
as we went
you have changed
he finally said
something of both perhaps
tell me something
not hard at all
i liked him
you being him
it runs in the family
but i remembered him clearly
a good job
i worked the proper shadow
and later that other place
you grow in strength slowly
i strengthened lorraine
no matter where you went
after your escape
all roads led to lorraine
and maybe a test
and why travel with me
can you not guess
i never named a successor
i have decided
you communicated with me
back in lorraine
and that land
it is clear
i have cleared it
i shook my head
i did it myself
at just the appropriate time
i squatted and studied it
i finally asked
i know that it is
i looked at him
a while back
toward the throne
you do what you do
as a duty
feel a duty now
toward the throne
more than that
but i realized something else
i am sorry
i looked away then
backdown at the smear
i heard him sigh
he snorted and chuckled faintly
that will do
the jewel was pulsing
he looked into my eyes
only working in reverse
i heard voices
what is the story
by the way
how did he do that
i do not know
benedict rose to his feet
then fall back
for how long
removed the deck
i had best be moving
she shook her head
are you sure
i am certain
i told him
i asked her
wherever you are going
i will go with you
i am riding alone
i could not accompany you
they are included
then she said
we entered the supply room
you know what i mean
i like you
if you feel anything
but i bit it back
she had used me
or could become
i like you
and i looked at her
so i did
then she was gone
i got some things together
seated outside it
it was dad
bare your left arm
i did this
then resheathed his blade
the blood came forth
he released my arm
stood on his hand
moved to his wrist
looked at me
even its eyes were red
the one you must follow
he told the bird
you must go now
where am i going
i asked him
to the courts of chaos
you know the way
he nodded slowly
then get moving
but i do not understand
when the time comes
by your friend here
what will he bring me
i fear not
is there no other way
i turned and mounted
but it was too late
i grew excited at this
across my path
a shifting of the wind
high on a rocky shelf
more of the blue flowers
i worked more changes
concerning my newfound strength
its lines were softer
illusion of feeling
i addressed everything mentally
o spirit of this place
masked by too many trees
bearing to the southwest
then finally the south
immense and venerable
i rode on
i had to
i kept shrubs
i reached out then
veins of agate
heaps of schist
a darkening of the greenery
the sun shimmering and dancing
we increased our pace
the land sank lower still
the forest retreated
another to my left
yellow and brown-flashed by
dust devils spun about us
the walls slanted inward
grew closer together
the way narrowed
their tops came together
slowing as it darkened
phosphorescent designs burst into being
we plunged past
red now the ferns
wider and lower
a great plain
pinking into evening
over pale grasses
the smell of fresh earth
a quick spray of moisture
memories and a rumbling noise
a strong wind
clouds across the stars
a tingling sensation
the smell of ozone
sheets of water upon me
clattering down a cobbled street
a strange vehicle approaching
we avoid one another
a shout pursues me
storefronts and homes
the rain lets up
a fog blows by
the terrain softens
a new wind
a growing warmth
the air breaks apart
sky of pale lemon
orange sun rushing toward noon
the ground moves beneath us
the new sky
the new sun
fade and return
there comes a cracking sound
we tread upon nothing
a steady cracking noise
fills my ears
who has paced many shadows
emits a frightened sound
i look all about me
blurred outlines appear
my environment is restored
we wheel to the left
racing for a low hill
halting finally at its summit
the black road
it ripples beneath my gaze
the cracking noise continues
looking in that direction
i shake the reins
we race southward
some broken buildings
a wall of flame
an armada of dirigibles crossing
stars become streaks
sounds dopplered from dark smears
brighter the light
fainter the prospect
to my right
forms run together
only the road is real
the worlds go by
the heart of a tornado
as though i am pursued
blotches of gray
a hint of blue
gentler the wind
shapes come and go
there is no path
i ride on mossy earth
the sky is blue
the clouds are white
i am very light-headed
i draw rein
tiny vehicles crawling along them
i looked back
i looked all around
i moved again
passing through shadow
i felt heavier here
took a drink of water
walked around a bit
my familiar bird circled
descended to my outstretched arm
the jewel of judgment
whatever it had amounted to
in the meantime
i had my orders
i remounted star
we moved again
then the reverse
all was a blur
points of light flashed past
like meteors or comets
as of a cosmic heartbeat
something was going wrong
it seemed hardly likely
a uniform twilight prevailed
but there were no stars
it was possible
an absolute silence contained us
the still air was cool
as i was about this
yet i had heard it
i turned slowly
looking in every direction
then it came again
only this time
i scanned the floating rocks
i considered it
whatever it was
you are locked here
i smiled as i mounted
come bar my way
towering full circle about me
star went wild
spoke soothing words
as i did this
the circle enlarged
came the voice
this place is too small
ride in any direction
i heard brand chuckle again
a pair of large rocks
i rode on by
continuing the course
across my path
brand caught on about then
according to specifications
beneath a jutting overhang
fuming with heady scents
at my back
the sound of thunder
abreast of us
a fragrance-killing wind pursues
the cracks widen
dark streaks race by
back upon themselves
the settling of a net
the labors of a giant
down and down
the ground again
our throbbing passage
softer the thunder
falling the wind
speed now and away
a narrowing of lines
and faster yet
myself coming back
through one another
what carroll mirror
far to my left
a black thing writhing
we pace the road
it leads me on
white ground and no horizon
only that thread of black
and gleaming pyramids everywhere
i was tired
barely halting at my extremities
it was a movement
the pyramids shuffled by
darkening as they passed
watching landscapes flash by beneath
light streamed upward past me
and the fleecy ground darkened
when the light came again
bluish this time
we wind along its course
for an age
this goes on
another age goes by
entering that wood
pale and shiny
hangs about me
working our way inward
comes that voice again
watched him emerge from it
may we talk
i told him
whatever it is
for the jewel
i said nothing
dad has already used it
how could you know
i can see through shadow
with a little mental effort
so i watched
he is dead
touching the jewel
he shook his head
dad is dead
i saw him fall
as he had willed it
what happens next
things fall apart
and it grows
it spreads ever outward
destroying the shadow worlds
i felt dazed
had i struggled from greenwood
brand said softly
of course not
the location is unimportant
i have shed our blood
and i live here too
all of my plans-everything
he shook his head
it could not be
how could you do this
as you say
the pattern has been destroyed
you give me the jewel
things hold together
life goes on
what of chaos
with dad dead
he smiled crookedly
ought not i
i smiled back at him
considering the payoff
supposing dad did succeed
how should i know
might it negate ours
what do you think
given that situation
he shrugged his shoulders
i have already answered that
how should i know
but all right
you are wrong
but leave it at that
rather than see everything lost
or my help
i have heard you out
you are afraid
afraid of me
you need me now
i have made my choice
anything you want
looking through his eyes
listening with his ears
i began walking toward him
he took a step backward
i do not think so
he said hastily
not above the abyss
you have had your chance
you have had your chance
he retreated into the wood
i followed after
but he had vanished
along a road over nothing
supposing dad had failed
everything was already over
within that time frame
i swept along the bridge
how soon might it come
not too soon
sooner or later
swirled about me
filling up the world
occasional musical tones
as of rung crystal
my thoughts danced
and my father
merged and parted
parted and merged
he had judged
he had made his decision
and i was backing out
whether it was arrested development
growing slowly within me
i do not know
as a boy
and the later one when
step by step
seductions returned because
they were there
i was unable
as i rushed onward
no poetic license here
the colors of uniforms
banners and blood
this is your life
i was tired
i wrenched at my surroundings
i twisted things about
i broke free
we passed within
i built no fire
i felt a little sick
i did not move
a soft light
there was a figure
standing just inside
i was on my feet
may i share your cave
as if in answer
that much is true
make yourself comfortable
he sat down
about four meters separated us
mixed with the damp breeze
this is no natural storm
the other said
for one thing
this time of year
so much lightning
and behind it
things have grown very distorted
that happens in the rain
not that way
he might be wrong
something the matter
my horse is gone
could it have wandered off
i am just traveling through
i touched the jewel
i readied into it
then through it
out and up
with my mind
then i leaned back
how can you tell
according to some versions
and this is it
it will be all over
one way or the other
before too long
that stone you are wearing
it is giving off light
lightning upon his breast
when asked where he travels
he shall say
one enemy against another
where do you travel
not too far
it was letting up now
another to the east
no horses anywhere in sight
just as i did
you can have the blanket
and the drizzle halted
the rocks were slippery
i paused then
from that point
visibility a bit better
i listened for several minutes
to my left
near a dark boulder
cairn or rocky outcrop
about my ankles
i heard a grating
i saw small
the lighted area diminished
narrowed to a sliver
vanished with a booming sound
but heard nothing
whoever they were
they had taken my horse
and right now
so i groped about
knowing its situation
so i looked low
i pulled then
but it was stubborn
so the decision was made
the door creaked
i kept pulling
i did not slacken
but increased my effort
it creaked again
i leaned backward
flexing my arms
no gradual pressure this time
i yanked and shoved simultaneously
grinding as it moved
it seemed freer now
fractured in several places
there was illumination beyond
beside the stairway
but the music continued
a twisted bolt
in a smoky
hordes of meter high people
red-faced and green clad
slapping tabletops and each other
laughing and shouting
huge kegs lined one wall
the silence was almost complete
from off to my right
one of the men
cleared his throat
begging your pardon
i will wait
i will do that
and he darted by
giving me wide berth
bring the man his horse
i lowered my blade
we will be foraging elsewhere
no hard feelings
seeing my expression
he sipped from it himself
join us in a drink
he said then
let me fetch you another
for the trail
it was a pleasant ale
another joined him
sit a spell
said my host
the pitcher between us
said my companion
nor explaining either
he grinned and winked
we will not starve
tell me about it
just a stone
the dancing resumed
the voices grew louder
the fire undulated
that it is
i did not think so
if you wish
somehow all danger seemed past
so far from here
in some field
they were warming me now
i watched the dancers
the little man was talking
everyone else was ignoring me
it lulled me
even drew a few chuckles
wiser self was warning me
you have had enough
magically it seemed
my glass had been refilled
one more is all right
said my other self
ca not you feel it
but i was tired
perhaps it would be prudent
i felt myself nodding
i was pleasantly warm now
i caught myself nodding
of my personal safety
i mumbled something
it would be so good
dropped to a drone
i sat bolt upright
the musicians continued their performance
my anger returned
i had a mission
i took a deep breath
the music was still playing
rising to my feet
turn to statues
all of you
upon my breast
my diminutive assailants were poised
the nearest ones stood stock-still
as i followed
when we emerged
as i mounted
as i headed us south
i drew rein
and where do you travel
he called after me
i shouted back
fare thee well
i waved to him
perhaps it had
moving this way
why should it remain
i had used the jewel
i looked to the east
from whence the day brightened
but rather a great
notes almost like laughter
the farther one traveled
the stranger they sometimes grew
are we pleased with it
proud of it
or are they there
independent of us
awaiting our footfalls
there is a place
the things that we find
the existence of this place
says that here
there is a difference
and if here
was such a place
a place where the
are we pleased with it
proud of it
need not apply
whatever i ultimately believed
we moved ahead
for a moment
only it was enormously brighter
then we were failing
after the initial shock
i lost track of time
was i moving
or merely hovering
was the brightness really brightness
and that deadly silence
in my old cell
near subliminal in its brevity
this time to my left
how long the interval between
i could not say
was very brief
there and gone
off to my left
less than two seconds worth
snatches of wailing
a ghostly mountain
taut rope about her neck
head twisted to the side
hands tied behind her back
black clouds beneath
a tiny thrill of vibration
dripping black gore
a chuckle from nowhere
the white light again
rolling and heaving
the moment it was gone
i reached for it again
through the jewel
a rocky trail
approaching a high mountain pass
at my back
a crashing like thunder
it came back again
heartbeats against the growling background
the world grew brighter
the air was cold
none fell upon me
i glanced back
we entered the pass
dismount and walk around
this was no ordinary storm
brightening my way
interspersed with silvery trees
traversed by drifting wraiths
almost terraced-seeming in places
natural and rolling in others
rising and falling
i did not hesitate
but began my descent
i did not hurry now
but saw no people
the wind made a soft
the mists still drifted
the pale grasses sparkled damply
wondering about it
if dad had failed
i would have tried
that was enough
even if everything was lost
clad in white
she had long
dark hair and wild
and she was smiling
she carried a wicker basket
you must be hungry
knight at arms
i saw you come
i brought you this
i quirked an eyebrow
my pavilion is farther back
along the lake
she gestured with her head
suspicion was with me
if you wish
she spread a cloth
seated herself across from me
she served it then
but only a trifle
she was an ideal audience
laughing at all my jokes
making me talk about myself
as she cleared the cloth
it is coming
shall we drink to it
i will drink with you
but not to that
it does not matter
come to my pavilion now
taking my hand
i have a mission
it is not that important
she went on
i bowed my head
what the hell
she was probably right
when her mask was removed
at the time
are not most of us
i liked her
i finished my wine
she looked up at me
you almost persuaded me
the sedge was not withered
the sky was still streaked
black and white
still the breeze
and we were slowed
passing within that wide
pushing on against it
as i rode
i glanced that way
but saw nothing
half a minute later
star jerked beneath me
let out a terrible neigh
turned sharply to the right
i leaped clear
i hit the ground rolling
about ten meters above me
it did not
dropping the crossbow
almost directly across from me
you son of a bitch
you killed my horse
as i crossed the trail
an instant later
bent nearly double
massaging his arm
it was brand
this is it
the wind howled about us
he simply faded before me
his outline grew less distinct
i stood for a moment
brand was below
i hurried to it
he was nowhere in sight
i felt very exposed
i dropped to the ground
falling across my rock
a moment later
i stood again
i saw him
and about twenty meters distant
sorry about the horse
i was aiming for you
but those damned winds
from that wedge-shaped fissure
a difficult shot
he called out
raising the weapon
a challenge to my marksmanship
but certainly worth the effort
i have plenty more quarrels
sighted and fired
i bent low
there were none nearby
i reached for it
i reached out for them
nowhere near me
when he was ready
i saw him sight
it just occurred to me
he called out
have not you
that is cheating
he looked all about
but not yet
brand faded and vanished again
i sought him everywhere
then he faced me
on the other hand
before you shoot
tell me one thing
the coming of chaos
a series of short barks
he stated then
the red bird
the jewel bearer
circling for another dive
then the bird
not yet the end
having traversed the pass
in the sky
you are sentient
i am sorry
i needed a staff
through this valley
i took a step forward
i am his son
then take my limb
he planted me
i am no ordinary tree
of what sort
i mark a division
beyond me other rules apply
who can say
my staff may comfort you
it may not
who can say
bear it with you
i feel a storm approaching
then things cleared a bit
a stagnant pool
a smell of decay
it announced then
you are the one
the one what
the one i will accompany
it chuckled then
and executed a little dance
in this place
i resumed walking
i will bet
he fluttered away from it
that was not funny
i thought it was
i walked on by
for a long while
then i would pass it
and somewhat stately
produced by a steel-stringed instrument
as i slogged along
halt and regard me
where are you
the head was bald
the skin pale as milk
i said then
can you free your arms
if i strain mightily
came the reply
that is not necessary
i moved nearer and stared
i have seen you
do you feel my plight
it is your question
you answer it
where do you travel
do not waste your time
he is indeed the one
said the sunken giant
are not you
do not do it
it is not worth it
you turned me down
not that sort of release
that is easily done
let it end for them
i turned and walked on
he called after me
as i hiked along
burned my foot
how had he do that
okay if i rest here
he is groping after something
he went on
i meant philosophically
that sort of mud
is that so
this is a big mistake
in the mud
as i do that other
you are missing the point
that you will be fake
what is wrong with that
the world of phenomena
i like being alone
i like phenomena
calling to you
i see what you mean
everyone has a few
i agree with you
that is correct
though strewn lightly with sand
through the fog
i saw dim shapes moving
what is the occasion
they are not mortals
but the spirits of time
he left my shoulder
flew above them and defecated
that was hardly necessary
it is a fine performance
for they anticipate your failure
leaning upon my staff
but that woman
in a perfectly timed gesture
and finally the music faded
the trail grew rougher
after a time
but that is about it
it should be
you admit the possibility
as i see it
i began walking
and they were growing louder
but its effects seemed blunted
by my own sluggishness
i listened for the thunder
all was silent
resting my back against it
no sense to merely wandering
one by one
i went through them all
dad had been right
there on the sand
for a long while
i listened for the storm
there were a few growls
but they were directionless
waiting for what
i was transporting the jewel
to what end
i thought of amber then
once i released it
it moved very slowly
its slowdown effect again
or an enormous distance farther
no matter what the distance
and the others
bones and soliloquies
if i could locate it
i could follow it
i reached out once again
parting the fogs
rolling them back
it was an animal
a large dog perhaps
was it stalking me
a big one
you are a little early
i was only resting
the beast said
it chuckled again
so did i
then feast your eyes
said the jackal
and that of chaos
royal blood appeals to me
prince of chaos
yet you have your ties
as well as your conflicts
at the moment
do you know the way
said the jackal
it is not far
as the carrion bird flies
do i move too fast
you seem tired
is it not
there is a tunnel
i followed it
as we walked
after a time
i called out
how much farther is it
not too far now
do you grow tired
i needed a guide
and we were heading uphill
i have not the time
the ground growing stonier
the angle of ascent steeper
i called to him
i erred in this
why not rest there
and i resumed walking
there you have it
said the jackal
the way is straight
take your passage through
and good speed to you
i appreciate this
he said from behind me
there came a soft
quick sound from behind me
so i spun
striking it on the shoulder
but that was all
the jackal shrieked
but lay there thrashing
in the dim light
the smell was overpowering
it said softly
back still against the wall
staff still before me
and regarded it
but only a cave
the fog had grown yellow
that way seemed somewhat steeper
but there was none about
i struggled along
always continuing upward
many-colored and churning
i increased my pace then
dropped toward me
i raised my staff
but maybe not good enough
i believe that it is
what is that
then come and tell me
as i mounted the slope
there came another thunderclap
no more growls and rumbles
i struggled higher
be here any minute
i continued climbing
for it was a high
as i moved
without getting wet
if it were
i was speaking figuratively
the vista before me enlarged
what is the matter
but i could not speak
how long i remained so
i am not certain
there is no way
you say you have failed
but this is not so
i looked back
but if dad failed
create a new pattern
i told him
it does not matter
you do not
if i fail here
it will become absolute
as for me
i must try
and he chuckled
the smell of the river
the smell of chestnut blossoms
just across the way
my right before my left
in my left hand
informed my perceptions
empowered my will
at my back
i could feel the storm
the sky was darkening
the storm blotting the swinging
flashes of lightning splayed about
having gone completely around
there were no sparks
no tinges in my feet
the taste of normandy cider
and in town again
the seine full of stars
a fight there
what was her name
a white rose
i sniffed then
it heartened me
i pushed ahead
curving gently to my right
slick as glass
obliterating everything it passed
the storm was indeed advancing
it was fitting that
there was distant thunder
and then it parted
the chestnut blossoms
berlin in the twenties
but of a different order
man or nation
i had forgotten
the smell of the chestnuts
i completed another circuit
but i was untouched
like the head
their laughter was the thunder
shadows crawled among them
now they spoke to me
i would fail
they told me
fail and be swept away
they cursed me
though none of it reached
and i took another step
they could feel my doubts
whatever they were
i told myself
i have come this far
i will continue
still mouthing discouragements
to my encounter with random
our fight with his pursuers
our journey back to amber
of the battles that followed
moving into even higher gear
through it all
nothing else was important
my concentration became total
whatever lay beyond the pattern
it did not matter
there was only the jewel
in a sense
i was obliterated
i became a moving point
programed by the jewel
at some level
for i knew
the way had become trickier
my movements even slower
despite the matter of velocity
in that strange
there was no drag
i felt very light
despite the deliberation
i was still emotionless
the world went dark
but only for an instant
the final assault
as on the old pattern
but for this
within the jewel
i completed it
treading on stars
my foot slowly advanced
just a little farther
it felt like forever
then i moved
i was through
the pressure was gone
the blackness was gone
for an instant
without even regarding it
i had done it
i realized dimly
come whatever may
there was a pattern
and it would endure
until it was too late
the light was almost normal
and blinking against it
you have done it
he waved the jewel
good-bye for now
and he vanished
like a surf
the chestnut trees
as he saw it
i almost wept
all of this
and on his own terms
i had failed
i had almost made it
the air was still
i opened my eyes
i turned my head
a few blossoms had opened
from that direction
i felt along my sides
turning my head
i regarded the prospect
the plateau was the same
yet somehow not the same
altered rock formations
it reminded me of something
i sighed again
in spite of myself
unused feeling about it
it was like the place
of the primal pattern
this was a new place
a new primal pattern
this was a clean
looking around me
i was sober again
i dusted myself off
it would still be there
i looked all around me
there was mystery here
i saluted the tree
i saw it then
beneath that wild sky
the scene adjusted itself
a moment later
the sky was that crazy
firefly gleams flickering about it
drifted in the air
at my back
flashing and growling
drawing my blade
where the hell was brand
when he swung
because i cut his throat
i whirled then
and i mounted
he was skittish at first
lines of them
on the other hand
brand was nowhere in sight
seeking a lone figure
where the hell was brand
i needed a better view
and he sat facing me
still as a statue
you are not mailed
i slapped my chest
he nodded sharply
then he reached up
first to his left shoulder
then to his right
then to his sides
opening fastenings upon his breastplate
when he had them undone
he removed it
the name was familiar
then i remembered
a master of the blade
battle is not a game
especially a skilled ass
when i was feeling beat
if nothing else
he gave chase immediately
you flee combat
at either hand
then my waist
the black went on
i moved to my right
facing the draw
it swept over him
drawn blade and all
i kicked then
and his horse
i leaped after him
this took me several minutes
as i continued northward
i achieved higher ground
i kept going
toward the advancing storm
i soon reached my goal
the highest hill in sight
swinging an ax
swinging a heavy blade
assessing the distribution of forces
sweeping down the slope
reinforcing their lines
pushing our troops back
the enemy pressed harder
toward the west
then he lowered the blade
for a moment
i thought brand was there
they were holding their line
they were pressing forward
the storm had advanced considerably
and this cold
i wondered then
would these follow
i doubted this
if this storm smashed us
i simply could not guess
what was he waiting for
a tiny flash of red
i kept watching
a minute passed
i wheeled the black charger
he had chosen a good
but it diminished with distance
that troubled me
and if he did not
then what could i do
hunting him again
i did not know
as i rode
gaining on them
as the case might be
or minimize them
i leaned forward
still bearing to my left
hurrying my horse along
the sky kept turning
the wind whistled about me
i did not look back
i was racing them
they would probably wait
i began shouting
i screamed after them
wait for me
i turned toward my right
behind the retreating forces
the horse had run off
was perhaps fifty meters away
several were moving
more were not
none had yet risen
brighter and steadier now
i began crawling forward
upward and to my left
i made my way carefully
any minute now
before too long
then some rocks
i kept crawling
and i did so
i kept expecting another flash
i reached out
but i could not
i drew my blade
when i reached my goal
there was no red glow
no shadowy figure either
could he have teleported again
and if so
i moved that way
two different voices
i mounted this
so i continued
i heard voices
but the words were agitated
but they stood perfectly still
brand stood in that place
she was unhelmed
her hair blowing wild
i dropped back
i heard random say softly
i can hold him here
and at this range
but that is all
anything else i might try
he can counter
random gnawed his lower lip
put down your weapons
brand called out
do it now
brand was still
i ventured another look
i heard random say
before anyone answered him
a strange thing occurred
then sought it overhead
the clouds were still there
even as i watched
there was a perceptible brightening
nothing that i can tell
as if stirred
forms tossed within it
on the field
the sounds of battle lessened
i do not know
i tell you
before it finished taking form
the face moved
his lips moved
i send you this message
rejoice or mourn
as you would
he went on
but with the jewel
in that place
he sounded quite mad now
with my passing
the voice continued
let it be
a little while
and it was gone
as you can see
i heard brand saying
i do not care
leave me alone
i could if i would
i could turn it aside
she said gently
you will earn our gratitude
forgiven and forgotten
you forgive me
what do you want
riches and treasure
an important appointment
all of these
they are yours
let us end it
all of us will
i do not believe you
in this sense
get out of here
it is burning you
i heard him scream
wherever you are
i will kill her
i rose to my feet
her left cheek bloody
then her arm was free
as soon as she moved
there was a silver flash
i was running by then
vanished from sight
and it all went away
when i came around
hear their voices
that is how it was
my feelings would never change
now she was gone
with the jewel gone
everything was over
i reached out
wherever it might be
but there was nothing
you are beat
take it easy
in a little while
it will not matter
not that much worth seeing
their combatants slain or captured
everyone moving in this direction
i looked behind us
i claim that distinction
i will be damned
rubbing my jaw
i heard about it
you ever kill yourself
how had you manage it
walked to the proper shadow
he provided the corpse
an eerie feeling
and destroy it
i finally succeeded
as you saw
but i had no choice
it was our last chance
i looked away
i had no choice
but they could wait
you or brand
you have that wrong
waiting for a stirring
when it came
yet he knew
it is entirely possible
random drew nearer
addressing their troops
i forgot them
you stabbed me
have a drink
passing me his flask
it was a dilute wine
i gulped it
my thirst was immense
tell me about it
i owe you that
damn your eyes
he shook his head
not always that
and it was coming true
i made one effort later
but it failed
when was that
i masked myself
i finally found him
thanks a lot
that would be nice
on the other hand
we cast about
seeking its source
my eyes followed his gesture
what can it be
i think i know
passing along the black road
chapter 12 i watched
hemmed by steel
turned their attention that way
long columns of them
reaching high above his head
lighting their way
the music grew stronger
despite the distance
tossing their heads and blowing
cracking long black whips
taloned-playing upon instruments like bagpipes
these marched on
like a migration of fireflies
there were ghostly drummers
clad all in black
of singing and skirling
wound the procession
draped with our unicorn flag
it is thus
i do not know why
but somehow it is fitting
now it is over
for you are dead
i am sorry
that i finally knew you
i will never know
someone i could trust
and that it was you
julian said softly
beyond chaos and amber
and so it is
if he succeeded
but if he did not
it does not matter
whether or not he succeeded
because i did
what do you mean
i believe that he failed
that gave me the idea
but i succeeded
no matter what else happens
what if dad succeeded
i do not know
it is my understanding
what would happen
so it would seem
it does not matter
and it will
followed by marching drummers
now it is over
already your image blurs
he was my companion
he was you
were there many friends
i think not
i bid you farewell
whom i have loved
you have preserved your mystery
rest in peace
if that be your will
casting it into the abyss
i will miss you
the lightning still flared
watching them pass
i could not tell
that i ached all over
that i could barely stand
come and lie down
i felt even weaker now
she pulled them off
my feet throbbed
i closed my eyes
how long this lasted
i do not know
i was regarded
i looked back
there lies the hero
said a soft voice
i said nothing
i recognized the voice then
i could not help it
i could not control it
her feelings were already plain
she told me
i thought about shrugging
she said then
i am sorry
yet understanding and sometimes gentle
much closer now
was flaring at her back
i am going now
back to my own people
she gestured toward the storm
i could only stare
not at the raging elements
what about benedict
i asked softly
and she turned away
there was a silence
i simply did not know
there within the shadows
brand and dad gone
i lay back and sighed
i had been dozing again
though only for a moment
with rations and a flask
someone was with her
so i waited
but i can guess
since she is gone
i swallowed some wine
despite my state of mind
they tasted good to me
we will be moving soon
can you ride
i think so
but too much has happened
i told her
i have gone numb emotionally
i have found my family
i have gone numb
she kissed me
we are not yet beaten
you will be yourself again
i shook my head
if i shout
a hand of painted pasteboards
leave me here
i am only the joker
you are coming
it is not fair
i said softly
there is still some time
as i did
she went on
he was not a combatant
i had just become nervous
far off to my left
i looked into his eyes
i rose to my feet
still holding his hand
do not get up
it is all right
i clasped him to me
then released him
i am glad
drink with me
i offered him the wine
he took it
he did the same
tell me of yourself
what are you like
how has life treated you
he looked away
growing up in the courts
this is not true anymore
do you think i might
it is quite possible
that amber no longer exists
one way or the other
there is a pattern
i told him
he looked away
he finally said
after a pause
as my father
my feelings were mixed
it was strange
began pulling them on
they are most convenient
then i saw her
a white form
pawing air it seemed
regarding us all
chapter 13 for a moment
how long we stood thus
i could not tell
on the slopes
the prisoners had been bound
limned against that wild sky
could she really help us
her eyes lighted upon me
this was not possible
for a moment
i sighed involuntarily
at that moment
she advanced another step
at her next step
i saw the glitter again
how she had retrieved it
i had no idea
and it did not matter
benedict and several nobles stood
but i did not
with my passing
but remained a soft
carried to me
i went and joined them
so did my son
i accept your allegiance
now get up
all of you
as we did
the unicorn turned and bolted
it is yours now
i think not
my mind felt disassociated
about this king business
it caught me totally unprepared
probably a very good job
if there were
they did not show
you were a good choice
so much has happened recently
dad sheltered us actually
but it is true
the end of a vendetta
he and i
but after his death
you are welcome to it
if amber still exists
he said after a time
i will try
the light came through
its insides seemed clear
he did this
i told him
think of the pattern
its palely glowing lines
summoning it into fullness
what do you see
i asked him
something like the pattern
come with me then
we must go to it
that feeling of movement
drifting at first
i willed us ahead
feeling random beside me
only our passage was soundless
we crashed through the barriers
we were surrounded by steady
flowing walls of brightness
i felt myself growing faint
we sped ahead
after a timeless interval
if it came to that
we swept on
my sense rebelling
the dizziness recurring
i fought down panic
it was no good
i felt myself slipping away
everything swam away from me
there were voices
feet toward a campfire
it is all right
it is all right
i turned my head
he is all right
random bore you back
he thinks so
but i sat up anyway
where is he
she gestured with her eyes
on a shelf of rock
facing the storm
it was very close now
the thunder boomed almost constantly
only a few minutes
then ordered a troop withdrawal
they are crossing over
i turned my head
gossamer strands drifted between us
about the nighted hulk
rather than amber
i said to her
i shook my head
so did merlin
are you coming
and the king
so be it
i watched random
who stood unmoving
facing the storm
may i fetch you some
one way or another
we had an intact pattern
maybe even two
we had a new king
it seemed sincere to me
nothing drove me now
with all this behind me
it was all right
you are far from here
as i did
i watched the storm
or something like that
in many ways
a delicious feeling
life felt good
what might await me there
i could not tell
i dismissed the thought
it did not matter
tell me more
this whole conflict
how did it get started
and return to amber
i said then
standing against the storm
it broke before us
random is gone now
appointed by the unicorn
anointed by the storm
even in slumber
i have slept
even as merlin now dozes
a world which endures
i have said my good-byes
he would understand
in this way
had you lived so long
of them all
in some ways
and you brand
you almost destroyed us
you were mad and evil
that you had died sooner
my brothers and sisters
you have insulted me
i am grateful
exuberant and rash
for the first
for the second
you have changed the most
take my fondness
i owe you
a thing apart from mercy
begins at home
toting up my balance sheets
looking for credits
we are not enemies
any of us
and that should be sufficient
let it go
let it be
then goodbye to you too
princess of chaos
it might have been fun
the way ahead intrigues me
from hell to hallelujah
i have back my eyes
even on judgment day
merlin is stirring now
and this is good
drawing power from the jewel
they are cold
as random has done
we ready our gear now
merlin and i
i must go there
the roadway drifts before us
the time has come
we mount and move forward
we shall see
good-bye and hello
